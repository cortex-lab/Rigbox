The notes provide extra details about Signals. Please report any errors as GitHub issues. Thanks!</p><h2 id="2">What are signals?</h2><p>When writing an experiment definition (expDef), it's useful to think of signals as nodes in a network, where each node holds a value that is the result of passing its inputs through a function.  This network is 'reactive' in that whenever a node's input values change, the node recalculates its own value.  In this way changes propergate through the network asynchronously.</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="./images/node_graph_phase.png" alt=""> </p><p>The above node graph would be the result of writing the following:</p><pre class="codeinput">t = sig.test.create; <span class="comment">% returns a signal</span>
phi = 2*pi*3*t; <span class="comment">% a new signal, phi, that defines phase over time, t</span>
</pre><p>Imagine the signal <tt>t</tt> was a clock signal whose value was a timestamp that constantly updated.  The signal <tt>phi</tt> then updates it's value every time <tt>t</tt> updates.  In this way you can express relationships between variables in an easy to read, mathematical way.  One of these variables happens to be time, which means you can define how variables change over time.  In the above example we have defined a temporal fequency in Hz (the value of <tt>t</tt> in your expDef is in seconds from experiment start).  This can then be applied to a visual stimulus property, as shown in the example expDef <tt>driftingGrating.m</tt>.</p><h2 id="4">Relationships between signals</h2><p>Let's start to build a reactive network.

Spoiler: there's a function that creates a Gabor for you.</p><p>To live-plot a couple of interesting mathematical functions using Signals, see the end of this guide.</p><h2 id="26">A note about Signals variables</h2><p>Signals are objects that constantly update their values each time the Signals they depend on update.  When you do an operation on a signal (e.g. <tt>x * 2</tt>) a new Signal object is created.  This can be assigned to a variable (e.g. <tt>y = x * 2</tt>, however clearing or overwriting that variable does not affect the underlying Signal.  The original object stays around until its inputs or the network are deleted.  This is important to think about when writing expDefs.  Think of variables as temporary labels for each object which can be moved around at any time without affecting the object they label.  Consider the following:</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% Create a new input signal and assign it to the variable 'a'</span>
a = sig.test.create();
<span class="comment">% Derive a new signal from 'a' and assign it to the variable 'b'</span>
b = abs(a);

<span class="comment">% Reassign a value to 'a', e.g. a string.  Think of this as taking a</span>
<span class="comment">% sticker that says 'a' off the Signal object and placing it on a string</span>
<span class="comment">% instead:</span>
a = <span class="string">"hello"</span>; <span class="comment">% assign "hello" to variable 'a'.</span>
<span class="comment">% Note that this doesn't affect the Signal object originally assigned to</span>
<span class="comment">% 'a', but now if you do something to 'a', you're not working with a Signal</span>
<span class="comment">% anymore, but rather a char array:</span>
b = abs(a)
</pre><pre>  Undefined function 'abs' for input arguments of type 'string'.</pre><p>This may seem obvious but important to note as this can be unclear to people not used to this way of programming.</p><p>Likewise if you re-define a Signal, any previous Signals will continue using the old values and any future Signals will use the new values, regardless of whether the variable name is the same.  Remember that variable names are simply object handles so clearing or reassigning those variable names doesn't necessarily change the underlying object:</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% Let's start with a blank slate</span>
clear <span class="string">variables</span>
<span class="comment">% Create a new input signal, x, and assign it to the variable 'a'</span>
a = sig.test.create(<span class="string">'names'</span>, <span class="string">"x"</span>);
b = a^2; <span class="comment">% Derive a signal ('a^2') and assign it to variable 'b'</span>
c = b + 2; <span class="comment">% Derive a new signal ('a^2 + 2') and assign it to variable 'c'</span>
b = a*3; <span class="comment">% A new Signal object ('a*3') is assigned to the variable 'b'</span>
d = b + 2; <span class="comment">% A new Signal object ('a*3 + 2') is assigned to the variable 'd'</span>
</pre><p>The key here is that <tt>d</tt> has the value <tt>a*3 + 2</tt> and <b>not</b> <tt>a^2 + 2</tt>, even though the variable <tt>b</tt> was at one point <tt>a^2</tt>.  Counting each mathematical value in the above code block (i.e. mathematical variables and constants), how many nodes are in our network? The answer is 9 (see note 2).</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="./images/node_var_assign.png" alt=""> </p><p>Variables are like labels, if you reassign them they are no longer pointing to the same object.</p><p>Looking at the name of your Signals may help you better understand what they are</p><pre class="codeinput">y = abs(a);

</pre><h2 id="32">Signals only update when all their inputs have have values</h2><p>As you may have noticed, signals can be derived from any number of other signals, as well as by constants(3). Mathematically, Signals can be viewed as variables which, any time they take a new value, cause any dependent equations to be re-evaluated.</p><p>This leads us to one of the most important things to consider when writing an expDef: Signals can only update if all (or enough) of their inputs have values.</p><p>At the beginning of an Experiment your expDef function is called and all your signals are wired up.  Until the experiment starts however, none of these signals have any value.  Each signal can only update its value when its inputs have updates and the time that this happens depends on how you wire your network.</p><p>In the below example we have signals  x, a, b, and c.  From these, we derive a new signal and assign it to 'y'. If x updates, y won't because the expression is still incomplete, we don't have values for a, b, or c. Likewise if b updates, y will remain unchanged and any signals derived from y will likewise not update.  The signal y can only have a value once all the input signals have a value.  When all inputs have values, a change to any of the inputs will cause y to be revaluated using the most recent value of all the inputs.</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% Here we create four signals that each update in staggered fashion:</span>

Once all of its inputs have a value whenever any of them updates a new value is calculated using the most recent values of each input.</p><h2 id="35">Conditional statements</h2><h2 id="36">iff</h2><p>Above we saw how logical operations work with Signals. These can also be used in conditional statements that alter the value or operation on a given Signal.  Using an if/else statement won't work in your expDef.  To construct something similar to an if/else statement, we can use the <tt>iff</tt> method:</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% Create a signal whose values go from 1 - 200</span>
x = sig.test.sequence(1:2:200, 0.05);
<span class="comment">% if x is greater than 100, y = 100, otherwise y = x</span>
y = iff(x &gt; 100, 100, x);

<span class="comment">% Plot the results</span>
ax = sig.test.plot(x, y, <span class="string">'k-'</span>);
ax.XLim = [0 200]; ax.YLim = [0 200];
</pre><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="SignalsPrimer_03.png" alt=""> </p><p>Note that with <tt>iff</tt> any and all values can be signals.</p><h2 id="39">cond</h2><p>In order to construct if/elseif statements we use the cond method, where the input arguments are predicate-value pairs, for example:</p><pre class="codeinput">y = cond( <span class="keyword">...</span>
  x &lt; 5, a, <span class="keyword">...</span><span class="comment"> % If x &lt; 5, y = a</span>
  x &gt; 10, b); <span class="comment">% elseif x &gt; 10, y = b</span>
</pre><p>As with all Signals, the condition statement is re-evaluated when any of its inputs update.  Any input may be a Signal or otherwise, and if no predicate evaluates as true then the resulting Signal does not update.</p><p>Likewise, the condition statement will terminate if any of the source Signals of a particular pred-value pair do not yet have values.  Also, in the same way as a traditional if-elseif statement, each predicate is only evaluated so long as the previous one was false.  For this reason, the order of pred-value pairs is particularly important. Below we use true as the last predicate to ensure that the resulting Signal always has a value.</p><pre class="codeinput">y = cond(<span class="keyword">...</span>
  x &gt; 0 &amp; x &lt; 5, a, <span class="keyword">...</span><span class="comment"> % if x between 0 and 5, y = a</span>
  x &gt; 5, b, <span class="keyword">...</span><span class="comment"> % elseif x is greater than 5, y = b</span>
  true, c); <span class="comment">% else y = c</span>
</pre><h2 id="41">Indexing</h2><h2 id="42">Indexing into a Signal</h2><p>Signals can be indexed as expected with brackets and the colon operator.</p><pre class="codeinput">A = sig.test.create;
a = A(2); <span class="comment">% index second element of A</span>
B = A(5:end); <span class="comment">% index elements 5 to array end</span>
</pre><h2 id="43">Indexing with a Signal</h2><p>Another Signal may be used to index another Signal.  In the below example we derive a signal indexes the value of A with the value of i.  The resulting signal will update whenever i or A update, so long as both of them have a value.</p><pre class="codeinput">i = sig.test.create; <span class="comment">% Define a new Signal</span>
a = A(i);
</pre><p>If the value of A has a length less than the value of i, an 'index out of bounds' error will be thrown, just like with normal arrays.  One solution to this would be to use a conditional signal like the one in the previous section to deal with such cases:</p><pre class="codeinput">i = iff(i &gt; numel(A), numel(A), i);
a = A(i);
</pre><h2 id="45">selectFrom</h2><p>The selectFrom method allows for indexing from a list of Signals whose values may be of different types.  In some ways this is comparable to indexing into a cell array:</p><pre class="codeinput">y = i.selectFrom(A, B, C); <span class="comment">% when i == 1, y = A, etc.</span>
</pre><p><b>NB</b>: When the index is out of bounds the Signal simply doesn't update. This could also be used to e.g. map a choice signal to a bunch of outcome signals.</p><h2 id="47">indexOfFirst</h2><p>The indexOfFirst method returns a Signal with the index of the first true predicate in a list of Signals.  This has a similar functionality to <tt>find(arr, 1, 'first')</tt>:</p><pre class="codeinput">idx = indexOfFirst(A &gt; 5, B &lt; 1, C == 5); <span class="comment">% Better examples welcome!</span>
</pre><p><b>NB</b> If not all input signals have values, or none of them are true (i.e. non-zero) then the value idx will equal the number of inputs + 1.  This is a rare exception to the rule that signals don't update unless all their inputs have a values.  The below example will produce a signal that will only update with a valid index:</p><pre class="codeinput">idx = indexOfFirst(x, y, z);
<span class="comment">% Keep when value is less than or equal to number of inputs (i.e. 3)</span>
idx = idx.keepWhen(idx &lt; 4);
</pre><h2 id="49">map</h2><p>Not all MATLAB functions work natively with Signals.  For example, the function <tt>ischar</tt> does not play nicely with Signal objects:</p><pre class="codeinput">A = sig.test.create; <span class="comment">% Create an new signal</span>
B = ischar(A);
class(B) <span class="comment">% Note that B is not a Signal object but a boolean.</span>
</pre><p>In the above example, MATLAB is testing the object <i>itself</i>, rather than the <i>value</i> of A (see note 4).  For this reason B isn't a Signal object and will never be true, even is the value of signal A is a char.  The solution to this problem is to use the <tt>map</tt> method.</p><p><tt>map</tt> creates a new signal that calls an arbitraty function with the value of its input.  This new signal's value is the output of the function you give it.</p><pre class="codeinput">B = A.map(@ischar);
class(B) <span class="comment">% Returns a Signal object</span>
</pre><p>In the above example whenever signal A updates with a new value, its value is passed (or 'mapped') to the function <tt>ischar</tt> and the output (a boolean) becomes the value of signal B.  This means that B will update its value whenever A updates.  As usual, while A doesn't have a value, <tt>ischar</tt> is never called.</p><p>The @ symbol is MATLAB's syntax for a function handle.  Instead of calling the function, you simply point to the function as if it is a variable.  For more information, see the MATLAB documentation on <a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/creating-a-function-handle.html">creating function handles</a>.</p><p>In the below example we create a signal that can checks whether its input is a char and if so, converts it to a number:</p><pre class="codeinput">B = iff(A.map(@ischar), str2num(A), A);
</pre><p>Why use can we write <tt>str2num(A)</tt> and not <tt>ischar(A)</tt>?  You can see which methods work natively with Signals by looking at the following list:</p><pre class="codeinput">methods(<span class="string">'sig.Signal'</span>) <span class="comment">% All methods of the class sig.Signal</span>

If in doubt, map will always work, it just looks a little uglier:</p><pre class="codeinput">B = iff(A.map(@ischar), A.map(@str2num), A);
</pre><p>Another important thing to note is that operators like '==' and '*' are just convenient ways of calling normal functions (5).  They actually correspond to the functions <tt>eq</tt> and <tt>times</tt>.  Most of the time you can use either form but on occasion it's clearer to use one over the other.</p><pre class="codeinput">B = iff(A.map(@ischar), strcmp(A, <span class="string">'10'</span>), A == 10)
B = iff(A.map(@ischar), strcmp(A, <span class="string">'10'</span>), eq(A, 10)) <span class="comment">% These are equivalent</span>
</pre><p>The functions you call using map can be any function include your own non-builtin functions (although they need to be on the MATLAB search path).  You can also define local functions in your expDef and map values with those.  The functions used by <tt>map</tt> don't need to deal with Signal objects as they only get called with a signal's <i>value</i>.</p><p>What if your function expects single but your input signal's value is a double?  Simply typecast it with <tt>map</tt>!</p><pre class="codeinput">B = A.map(@single).map(@myfunc);
</pre><p>The value of A is called on <tt>single</tt> and its output is then called on <tt>myfunc</tt>. You'll notice that many Signals methods can be chained in this way, which is convient for writing one-liners.  If your line becomes too long or difficult to read you can also split it across a number of lines:</p><pre class="codeinput">B = A.map(@single);
B = B.map(@myfunc);
</pre><h2 id="58">Anonymous functions</h2><p>Sometimes your Signal must be in a different positional argument.  For this we simply create an anonymous function and use that.  See the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html">MATLAB doumentation</a> for more information on how to use these.</p><pre class="codeinput">delta = A.map(@(A) diff(A,1,2)); <span class="comment">% Take 1st order difference over 2nd dimension</span>
a = A.map(@(A) sum(A,2)); <span class="comment">% Take sum over 2nd dimension</span>
</pre><p>You may have noticed that our other example can be written using an anonymous function as a wrapper so that <tt>map</tt> is called just once:</p><pre class="codeinput">B = A.map(@(v) myfunc(single(v)));
</pre><p>Any of these variants will work just fine and there is no real atvantage to which one you choose, however if you need to access the intemediate value (i.e. single(v), it is better to use the former example.</p><h2 id="61">Example 2: a complex counter</h2><p>In the following example we have a signal, responseType, that may be an element of [-1 0 1].  A response type of 0 means the trial timed out before the subject gave a response.  Let's say we want to count the number of times in a row a trial timeout occurs:</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% First we store the responseType values for up to the last 1000 trials</span>
timeOuts = responseType.bufferUpTo(1000);
<span class="comment">% Then count the number of recent timeouts that occured in a row using an</span>
<span class="comment">% anonymous function that works on this array with find and sum:</span>
timeOutCount = timeOuts.map(@(x) sum(x(find([1 x~=0],1,<span class="string">'last'</span>):end) == 0));
</pre><h2 id="62">Sampling with map</h2><p>Map is particularly handy for 'sampling' functions, that is, for generating a new index, value, or whatever, each time an event occurs. Below we derive a signal, 'side', that each time 'newTrial' updates takes a new value from [-1 1].  Note that the anonymous function discards the value of 'newTrial'.  We're only using it as a way to trigger the evaluation of this function.</p><pre class="codeinput">newTrial = sig.test.create;
side = newTrial.map(@(~) sign(rand-0.5));
</pre><h2 id="63">at</h2><p>The method <tt>at</tt> will sample the value of a Signal each time another Signal updates. What's more, the Signal that updates must evaluate to true:</p><pre class="codeinput">x = sig.test.sequence(1:1:100, 0.15); <span class="comment">% An linear function</span>
y = sig.test.sequence(sin(1:.1:20), 0.1, <span class="string">'name'</span>, <span class="string">'y'</span>); <span class="comment">% A sine wave</span>
z = x.at(y &gt; .5); <span class="comment">% sample the values of x when the values of y &gt; 0.5</span>

sig.test.timeplot(x, y, z, <span class="string">'mode'</span>, [2,2,1], <span class="string">'tWin'</span>, 20); <span class="comment">% plot over 20 secs</span>
</pre><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="./images/at_example3.png" alt=""> </p><p>It's very important to remember that the new signal will only update when the second input updates and is true (so long as the first input has a value to sample).  For the value to be true, it must not be equal to 0. In other words, <tt>y = x.at(updatedAndNonZero)</tt>. As you can see 'z' keeps updating each time 'y' updates, even when 'x' stops updating (c.f. <tt>keepWhen</tt> method below).</p><h2 id="65">then</h2><p>There is another method called <tt>then</tt> which works the same way as <tt>at</tt>, but with the inputs in a reverse order.  This is simply to make things more self-documenting.</p><pre class="codeinput">updatedAndTrue = y.at(updated);
updatedAndTrue = updated.then(y); <span class="comment">% These two lines are equivalent</span>
</pre><h2 id="66">Mapping constants</h2><p>Sometimes you want to derive a Signal whose value is always constant but nevertheless updates depending on another Signal, thus acting as a trigger for something.  This can be achieved by using a constant value instead of a function in <tt>map</tt>.  For example below we produce a signal that is always mapped to true and updates whenever its dependent value updates.</p><pre class="codeinput">seq = repmat(-2:2, 1, 5);
x = sig.test.sequence(seq, 0.2); <span class="comment">% Create a sequence</span>
y = x.at(x); <span class="comment">% Zero values are ignored</span>
updated = x.map(true); <span class="comment">% Updates to true each time x updates</span>
z = x.at(updated); <span class="comment">% All values map to true</span>

ax = sig.test.timeplot(x, y, z, <span class="string">'mode'</span>, [0,1,1]);
</pre><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="./images/at_example2.png" alt=""> </p><p>The above example is simply to demonstrate that you can map a value to 'true' when we care about the 'when' of a signal than the 'what'.  In the above code x and z do the same thing, but would be useful when you want to sampling one signal each time differnt signal updates, e.g.</p><pre class="codeinput">updated = y.map(true);
z = x.at(updated);
</pre><p>Note that if the input arg is a value rather than a function handle, it is truely constant, even if it's the output of a function:</p><pre class="codeinput">c = x.map(rand); <span class="comment">% use constant value of rand each times x updates</span>
rnd = x.map(@(~)rand); <span class="comment">% call rand each time x updates</span>
</pre><p>The tilda here means that the value of Signal x is ignored, instead of being assigned to a temporary variable or being mapped into the functon <tt>rand</tt>, thus <tt>rand</tt> is called with no arguments.</p><h2 id="70">keepWhen</h2><p>Another method for filtering signals is <tt>keepWhen</tt>.  This will keep the value of one signal so long as another signal evaluates true (i.e. is non-zero).</p><pre class="codeinput">x = sig.test.sequence(1:15, 0.25); <span class="comment">% Create a sequence</span>
isEven = mod(floor(x), 2) == 0; <span class="comment">% True when x is an even number</span>
y = x.keepWhen(isEven); <span class="comment">% Sample x when x is even</span>

ax = sig.test.timeplot(x, y, <span class="string">'mode'</span>, 1);
</pre><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="./images/keepWhen_example.png" alt=""> </p><p>What's the difference between <tt>keepWhen</tt> and <tt>at</tt> / <tt>then</tt>?  These two methods essentially do that same thing, however the result of <tt>keepWhen</tt> will update each time its first input updates, so long as its second input is non-zero.</p><pre class="codeinput">x = sig.test.sequence(1:1:100, 0.25); <span class="comment">% A linear function updating every 1/4 second</span>

</pre><p>Try playing with the update times and using <tt>at</tt> vs <tt>keepWhen</tt></p><h2 id="73">skipRepeats</h2><p><tt>skipRepeats</tt> creates a signal that only updates when its input updates with an unique value.  That is, when its input updates with a value that is different to the previous one.  It is important to realize that signals can repeatedly update with the same value, and each time a signal updates it can cause other signals to update depending on how you define them.  Below is an example of <tt>skipRepeats</tt>:</p><pre class="codeinput">seq = [0 0 2 2 0 0 -2 -2 0 0 0];
x = sig.test.sequence(seq, 0.45);
y = skipRepeats(x);

Remember that signals generally update whenever any of their inputs update.  Sometimes you want to use a value such as a user defined parameter to calculate something, but you don't want it to change at all.</p><pre class="codeinput">x = sig.test.sequence(0:9, 0.5);
y = x.map(true).skipRepeats.then(x);

</pre><h2 id="78">A note about syntax</h2><p>When we type something like <tt>A.map(pi)</tt> we are actually calling the method <tt>map</tt> on the object <tt>A</tt>.  A method is another word for a function associated with an object.  Signals are objects, and so far we've looked at various methods (i.e. functions) that work with them.  In MATLAB there are two ways of calling a method on an object, one is the traditional way e.g. <tt>func(obj)</tt> and the other is the 'dot syntax' way: <tt>obj.func()</tt>. These are the same, and you can use them interchangeably so long as 'obj' is a Signal (and not something else, like a double or logical).  Below are pairs of lines that are equivalent:</p><pre class="codeinput">S = sig.test.create; <span class="comment">% create a Signal object</span>

S = S.map(pi); <span class="comment">% Map values of S -&gt; pi, e.g. when S updates, return pi</span>

S = S.then(true); <span class="comment">% When S updates and is true, return true</span>
S = then(S, true);
</pre><h2 id="79">mapn</h2><p><tt>mapn</tt> takes any number of inputs where the last argument is the function that the other arguments are mapped to.  The arguments may be any combination of signals and normal data types.  It's important to note that the below 'dot notation' only works if the first input is a Signal, otherwise you must use the traditional syntax e.g. <tt>mapn(5, A, @f)</tt></p><pre class="codeinput">B = A.mapn(n, 1, @repmat); <span class="comment">% repmat(A,n,1)</span>
</pre><p><b>NB</b>: <tt>map</tt> will only assign the first output argument of the function to the resulting Signal.  Mapping to a variable number of output Signals is only possible with mapn:</p><pre class="codeinput">a = sig.test.create; <span class="comment">% if a = rand(1,1,3,1,2)</span>

This allows one to define signals that have some sort of history to them. This is similar to the fold or reduce functions found in other functional programming applications.</p><p>Below we take the value of <tt>x</tt> and return a value that is the accumulation of <tt>x</tt> by using <tt>scan</tt> with the function <tt>plus</tt>.  The third argument to <tt>scan</tt> here is the initial, or 'seed', value.  Because the seed is zero, the first time <tt>x</tt> takes a value, <tt>scan</tt> maps zero and the value of <tt>x</tt> respectively to the plus function and assigns the output to Signal <tt>y</tt>.

##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Writing an experiment definition
% The purpose of this script is to introduce Signals and guide the reader
% towards programming in a less procedural way.  After reading this you
% should will be able to create the experiments you want in Signals, using
% the <glossary.html Signals Experiment Framework>.  The guide may appear
% slow at first but sticking with it will greatly reduce the number of
% errors you will encounter while making your first experiment.

%% Introduction
% The live script that accompanies this document can be found in
% |signals/docs/turorials/using_signals.m|.  This script allows you to run
% the blocks of code shown here and plot the values of signals live.  To
% run a block of code, click on the section of interest and press Ctrl +
% Enter.
%
% For the purposes of demonstration we can create signals using the
% |sig.test.create| function, however in you expDef you can only create new
% signals based on the function's inputs.  <./expDef_inputs.html More on
% this later>.
% 
%   function expDefFn(t, events, parameters, vs, inputs, outputs, audio)
%
% Example expDefs can be found in |signals/docs/examples|.
%
% The bracketed numbers throughout this script correspond to notes at the
% bottom of the file.  The notes provide extra details about Signals.
% Please report any errors as GitHub issues. Thanks!

%% What are signals?
% When writing an experiment definition (expDef), it's useful to think of
% signals as nodes in a network, where each node holds a value that is the
% result of passing its inputs through a function.  This network is
% 'reactive' in that whenever a node's input values change, the node
% recalculates its own value.  In this way changes propergate through the
% network asynchronously.
% 
% <<./images/node_graph_phase.png>>
%
% The above node graph would be the result of writing the following:
t = sig.test.create; % returns a signal
phi = 2*pi*3*t; % a new signal, phi, that defines phase over time, t

%%%
% Imagine the signal |t| was a clock signal whose value was a timestamp
% that constantly updated.  The signal |phi| then updates it's value
% every time |t| updates.  In this way you can express relationships
% between variables in an easy to read, mathematical way.  One of these
% variables happens to be time, which means you can define how variables
% change over time.  In the above example we have defined a temporal
% fequency in Hz (the value of |t| in your expDef is in seconds from
% experiment start).  This can then be applied to a visual stimulus
% property, as shown in the example expDef |driftingGrating.m|.

%% Relationships between signals
% Let's start to build a reactive network.  Most of MATLAB's elementary
% operators work with signals in the way you would expect, as demonstrated
% below.  You may type ctrl + enter to run this entire secion at once...
x = sig.test.sequence(-50:1:50, 0.05); % Create a sequence
a = 5; b = 2; c = 8; % Some constants to use in our equation
y = a*x^2 + b*x + c; % Define a quadratic relationship between x and y

% Let's call a little function that will show the relationship between our
% two signals.  The plot updates each time the two input Signals update:
ax = sig.test.plot(x,y,'b-');
xlim(ax, [-50 50]);
%%%
% <<SignalsPrimer_01.png>>

%% Mathematical expressions 
% Signals allows a good degree of clarity in defining methematical
% equations, particularly those where time is a direct or indirect variable
%
%%% Example 1: cos(x * pi)
x = sig.test.sequence(0:0.1:10, 0.05); % Create a sequence
y = cos(x * pi);
sig.test.timeplot(x, y, 'mode', [0 2]); % Plot each variable against time
%%%
% <<SignalsPrimer_02.png>>

%%% Example 2: x -> degrees
% Let's imagine you needed a Signal that showed the angle of its input
% between 0 and 360 degrees:
x = sig.test.sequence(1:4:1080, 0.005); % Create a sequence
y = iff(x > 360, x - 360*floor(x/360), x); % More about conditionals later

sig.test.plot(x, y, 'b-');
xlim([0 1080]); ylim([0 360])
%%%
% <<SignalsPrimer_04.png>>

%% Logical operations
% Note that the short circuit operators && and || are not implemented in
% Signals, always use & and | instead.
x = sig.test.sequence(1:15, 0.2); % Create a sequence
bool = x >= 5 & x < 10; 

ax = sig.test.plot(x, bool, 'bx');
xlim(ax, [0 15]), ylim(ax, [-1 2])
%%%
% <<SignalsPrimer_05.png>>

%% mod, floor, ceil
% A simple example of using mod and floor natively with Signals:
x = sig.test.sequence(1:15, 0.2); % Create a sequence

even = mod(floor(x), 2) == 0;
odd = ~even;

sig.test.timeplot(x, even, odd, 'tWin', 1);
%%%
% <<SignalsPrimer_06.png>>

%% Arrays
% You can create numerical arrays and matricies with Signals in an
% intuitive way.  *NB* : Whenever you perform an operation on one or more
% Signal objects, always expect a new Signal object to be returned.  In
% the below example we create a 1x3 vector Signal, X, which is not an
% array of Signals but rather a Signal that represents a numrical array.
x = sig.test.sequence(1:5, 0.5); % Create a sequence
X = [x 2*x 3]; % Create an array from signal x
X_sz = size(X); % Reports the size of object's underlying value

%%%
% *NB*: Cell array syntax is not supported in Signals, that is the
% following won't produce a signal: 
X = {x x};
class(X)

%%%
%     ans =
% 
%         'cell'
%
% Although Signals can technically hold cell arrays as their values, it's
% best to avoid using them in your experiments.
%

%% Matrix arithmatic
Xt = X'; % X transpose
Y = Xt.^3 ./ 2;

%% Complicated expressions
% Below are some examples of more complex mathematical expressions that can
% be defined in Signals.  

%%% Example 1: Upper bound
% $upper bound = \frac{\max(\{|a|,|b|,|c|\})}{|a|} \times  \left(1 +
% \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)$

%%% Example 2: Gabor
% Let's reproduce the equation for generating a Gabor patch, i.e convolving
% a sinusoid with a 2D Gaussian function: 
%
% $G(x,y;\lambda, \theta, \psi, \sigma) = \exp\left(-\frac{x'^2+
% y'^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\exp\left(2\pi\frac{x'}{\lambda}+\psi\right)$
%
% Where:
%
% $x' = x cos(\theta) + y sin(\theta)$
%
% $y' = -x sin(\theta) + y cos(\theta)$

% Create some input signals for this demonstration.  xx and yy are vectors
% of the x and y coordinates of the Gabor, where (0,0) is the centre of the
% Gabor patch
[xx, yy, theta, sigma, lambda, phi] = sig.test.create(); 

% Create a 2-D grid coordinates based on the coordinates contained in
% vectors xx and yy
[X, Y] = xx.mapn(yy, @meshgrid);

% Calculate the rotated x and y coordinates for the Gabor filter.  The
% rotated coordinates allow us to define an elliptical window rotated by
% theta(1)
Xe = X.*cos(theta(1)) + Y.*sin(theta(1));
Ye = Y.*cos(theta(1)) - X.*sin(theta(1));
% And the rotated coordinates for the grating
Xc = X.*cos(theta(2) - pi/2) + Y.*sin(theta(2) - pi/2);

% Define our Gaussian function
gauss = exp(-Xe.^2./(2*sigma(1)^2) + -Ye.^2./(2*sigma(2)^2));
% The grating function scaled by the wavelegth and translated by the phase
grate = cos( 2*pi*Xc./lambda + phi );
G = gauss.*grate; % Convolve the two functions

%%%
% Every signal has a Name property that you can print or set.  This is
% useful for plotting and visualizing signals. Below we rename some of our
% signals to Greek letters then print our Gabor signal name:

% Rename a few of our signals for display purposes
theta.Name = char(hex2dec('03bb')); % Orientation
sigma.Name = char(hex2dec('03B8')); % Standard deviation of Gaussian envelope
lambda.Name = char(hex2dec('03C3'));% Wavelength
phi.Name = char(hex2dec('03C6')); % Phase offset
Xe.Name = 'x'''; Ye.Name = 'y'''; % Rename to X' and Y'
X.Name = 'x'; Y.Name = 'y'; % Rename to x and y

% And print their names to the command window
fprintf([...

  'Grating equation: %s\n',...
  'Convolved: %s\n'],...
  gauss.Name, grate.Name, G.Name)

% Signals, see the end of this guide.

%% A note about Signals variables
% Signals are objects that constantly update their values each time the
% Signals they depend on update.  When you do an operation on a signal
% (e.g. |x * 2|) a new Signal object is created.  This can be assigned to
% a variable (e.g. |y = x * 2|, however clearing or overwriting that
% variable does not affect the underlying Signal.  The original object
% stays around until its inputs or the network are deleted.  This is
% important to think about when writing expDefs.  Think of variables as
% temporary labels for each object which can be moved around at any time
% without affecting the object they label.  Consider the following:

% Create a new input signal and assign it to the variable 'a'
a = sig.test.create(); 
% Derive a new signal from 'a' and assign it to the variable 'b'
b = abs(a);

% Reassign a value to 'a', e.g. a string.  Think of this as taking a
% sticker that says 'a' off the Signal object and placing it on a string
% instead:
a = "hello"; % assign "hello" to variable 'a'.  
% Note that this doesn't affect the Signal object originally assigned to
% 'a', but now if you do something to 'a', you're not working with a Signal
% anymore, but rather a char array:
b = abs(a)
%%%
%    Undefined function 'abs' for input arguments of type 'string'.
%%%
%
% This may seem obvious but important to note as this can be unclear to
% people not used to this way of programming.
%
% Likewise if you re-define a Signal, any previous Signals will continue
% using the old values and any future Signals will use the new values,
% regardless of whether the variable name is the same.  Remember that
% variable names are simply object handles so clearing or reassigning those
% variable names doesn't necessarily change the underlying object:

% Let's start with a blank slate
clear variables
% Create a new input signal, x, and assign it to the variable 'a'
a = sig.test.create('names', "x"); 
b = a^2; % Derive a signal ('a^2') and assign it to variable 'b'
c = b + 2; % Derive a new signal ('a^2 + 2') and assign it to variable 'c'
b = a*3; % A new Signal object ('a*3') is assigned to the variable 'b'
d = b + 2; % A new Signal object ('a*3 + 2') is assigned to the variable 'd'

%%%
% The key here is that |d| has the value |a*3 + 2| and *not* |a^2 + 2|,
% even though the variable |b| was at one point |a^2|.  Counting each
% mathematical value in the above code block (i.e. mathematical variables
% and constants), how many nodes are in our network? The answer is 9 (see
% note 2).
% 
% <<./images/node_var_assign.png>>
%
% Variables are like labels, if you reassign them they are no longer
% pointing to the same object.
%
% Looking at the name of your Signals may help you better understand what
% they are
y = abs(a);
disp(['y = ' y.Name])

y = y^2;
disp(['y = ' y.Name])

z = [y y];
disp(['z = ' z.Name])
%%%
%   y = |a|
%   y = |a|^2
%   z = [|a|^2 |a|^2]
%
% It's fine to break long lines into multiple shorter lines by re-assigning
% to the same variable:
b = a * 2 * pi;
b = abs(b);
disp(b.Name)
%%%
%   b = |a*2*3.1416|

%% Signals only update when all their inputs have have values
% As you may have noticed, signals can be derived from any number of other
% signals, as well as by constants(3). Mathematically, Signals can be
% viewed as variables which, any time they take a new value, cause any
% dependent equations to be re-evaluated.
%
% This leads us to one of the most important things to consider when
% writing an expDef: Signals can only update if all (or enough) of their
% inputs have values.  
%
% At the beginning of an Experiment your expDef function is called and all
% your signals are wired up.  Until the experiment starts however, none of
% these signals have any value.  Each signal can only update its value when
% its inputs have updates and the time that this happens depends on how you
% wire your network.
%
% In the below example we have signals  x, a, b, and c.  From these, we
% derive a new signal and assign it to 'y'. If x updates, y won't because
% the expression is still incomplete, we don't have values for a, b, or c.
% Likewise if b updates, y will remain unchanged and any signals derived
% from y will likewise not update.  The signal y can only have a value once
% all the input signals have a value.  When all inputs have values, a
% change to any of the inputs will cause y to be revaluated using the most
% recent value of all the inputs.  

% Here we create four signals that each update in staggered fashion:
x = sig.test.sequence(1:5, 1, 'delay', 1); % Update once per second after a second
a = sig.test.sequence(1, 1, 'name', 'a', 'delay', 2); % Update after 2 seconds
b = sig.test.sequence(1, 1, 'name', 'b', 'delay', 3); % Update after 3 seconds
c = sig.test.sequence(1, 1, 'name', 'c', 'delay', 4);  % Update after 4 seconds

y = a*x^2 + b*x + c;

sig.test.timeplot(x, a, b, c, y);
%%%
% <<./SignalsPrimer_07.png>>
%%%
% As you can see from the above plot, the signal 'y' does not update until
% all its input signals have values.  Once all of its inputs have a value
% whenever any of them updates a new value is calculated using the most
% recent values of each input.

%% Conditional statements
%% iff
% Above we saw how logical operations work with Signals. These can also be
% used in conditional statements that alter the value or operation on a
% given Signal.  Using an if/else statement won't work in your expDef.  To
% construct something similar to an if/else statement, we can use the |iff|
% method:

% Create a signal whose values go from 1 - 200
x = sig.test.sequence(1:2:200, 0.05); 
% if x is greater than 100, y = 100, otherwise y = x
y = iff(x > 100, 100, x); 

% Plot the results
ax = sig.test.plot(x, y, 'k-');
ax.XLim = [0 200]; ax.YLim = [0 200];
%%%
% <<SignalsPrimer_03.png>>
%%%
%
% Note that with |iff| any and all values can be signals.

%% cond
% In order to construct if/elseif statements we use the cond method, where
% the input arguments are predicate-value pairs, for example:
y = cond( ...
  x < 5, a, ... % If x < 5, y = a
  x > 10, b); % elseif x > 10, y = b

%%%
% As with all Signals, the condition statement is re-evaluated when any of
% its inputs update.  Any input may be a Signal or otherwise, and if no
% predicate evaluates as true then the resulting Signal does not update.
%
% Likewise, the condition statement will terminate if any of the source
% Signals of a particular pred-value pair do not yet have values.  Also, in
% the same way as a traditional if-elseif statement, each predicate is only
% evaluated so long as the previous one was false.  For this reason, the
% order of pred-value pairs is particularly important. Below we use true as
% the last predicate to ensure that the resulting Signal always has a
% value.
y = cond(...
  x > 0 & x < 5, a, ... % if x between 0 and 5, y = a
  x > 5, b, ... % elseif x is greater than 5, y = b
  true, c); % else y = c

%% Indexing
%%% Indexing into a Signal
% Signals can be indexed as expected with brackets and the colon operator.
A = sig.test.create;
a = A(2); % index second element of A
B = A(5:end); % index elements 5 to array end

%%% Indexing with a Signal
% Another Signal may be used to index another Signal.  In the below example
% we derive a signal indexes the value of A with the value of i.  The
% resulting signal will update whenever i or A update, so long as both of
% them have a value.  
i = sig.test.create; % Define a new Signal 
a = A(i);

%%%
% If the value of A has a length less than the value of i, an 'index out of
% bounds' error will be thrown, just like with normal arrays.  One solution
% to this would be to use a conditional signal like the one in the previous
% section to deal with such cases:
i = iff(i > numel(A), numel(A), i);
a = A(i);

%% selectFrom
% The selectFrom method allows for indexing from a list of Signals whose
% values may be of different types.  In some ways this is comparable to
% indexing into a cell array:
y = i.selectFrom(A, B, C); % when i == 1, y = A, etc.
%%%
% *NB*: When the index is out of bounds the Signal simply doesn't update.
% This could also be used to e.g. map a choice signal to a bunch of outcome
% signals.

%% indexOfFirst
% The indexOfFirst method returns a Signal with the index of the first true
% predicate in a list of Signals.  This has a similar functionality to
% |find(arr, 1, 'first')|:
idx = indexOfFirst(A > 5, B < 1, C == 5); % Better examples welcome!
%%%
% *NB* If not all input signals have values, or none of them are true (i.e.
% non-zero) then the value idx will equal the number of inputs + 1.  This
% is a rare exception to the rule that signals don't update unless all
% their inputs have a values.  The below example will produce a signal that
% will only update with a valid index:
idx = indexOfFirst(x, y, z);
% Keep when value is less than or equal to number of inputs (i.e. 3)
idx = idx.keepWhen(idx < 4);

%% map
% Not all MATLAB functions work natively with Signals.  For example, the
% function |ischar| does not play nicely with Signal objects:
A = sig.test.create; % Create an new signal
B = ischar(A);
class(B) % Note that B is not a Signal object but a boolean.

%%%
% In the above example, MATLAB is testing the object _itself_, rather than
% the _value_ of A (see note 4).  For this reason B isn't a Signal object
% and will never be true, even is the value of signal A is a char.  The
% solution to this problem is to use the |map| method.
%
% |map| creates a new signal that calls an arbitraty function with the
% value of its input.  This new signal's value is the output of the
% function you give it.  
B = A.map(@ischar);
class(B) % Returns a Signal object

%%%
% In the above example whenever signal A updates with a new value, its
% value is passed (or 'mapped') to the function |ischar| and the output (a
% boolean) becomes the value of signal B.  This means that B will update
% its value whenever A updates.  As usual, while A doesn't have a value,
% |ischar| is never called.
%
% The @ symbol is MATLAB's syntax for a function handle.  Instead of
% calling the function, you simply point to the function as if it is a
% variable.  For more information, see the MATLAB documentation on
% <https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/creating-a-function-handle.html
% creating function handles>.
%
% In the below example we create a signal that can checks whether its input
% is a char and if so, converts it to a number:
B = iff(A.map(@ischar), str2num(A), A);

%%%
% Why use can we write |str2num(A)| and not |ischar(A)|?  You can see which
% methods work natively with Signals by looking at the following list:
methods('sig.Signal') % All methods of the class sig.Signal
%%%
%     Methods for class sig.Signal:
% 
%     Signal        buffer        delta         floor         keepWhen      map2          mod           onValue       rot90         sin           times         
%     abs           bufferUpTo    eq            ge            lag           mapn          mpower        or            round         skipRepeats   to            
%     all           colon         erf           gt            le            max           mrdivide      output        scan          sqrt          transpose     
%     and           cond          exp           horzcat       log           merge         mtimes        plus          selectFrom    str2num       uminus        
%     any           cos           fliplr        identity      lt            min           ne            power         setTrigger    strcmp        vertcat       
%     at            delay         flipud        indexOfFirst  map           minus         not           rdivide       sign          sum           
% 
%     Methods of sig.Signal inherited from handle.
%%%
% As you can see |str2num| is in the list but |ischar| is not.  If in
% doubt, map will always work, it just looks a little uglier:
B = iff(A.map(@ischar), A.map(@str2num), A);

%%%
% Another important thing to note is that operators like '==' and '*'
% are just convenient ways of calling normal functions (5).  They actually
% correspond to the functions |eq| and |times|.  Most of the time you can
% use either form but on occasion it's clearer to use one over the other.
B = iff(A.map(@ischar), strcmp(A, '10'), A == 10)
B = iff(A.map(@ischar), strcmp(A, '10'), eq(A, 10)) % These are equivalent 

%%%
% The functions you call using map can be any function include your own
% non-builtin functions (although they need to be on the MATLAB search
% path).  You can also define local functions in your expDef and map values
% with those.  The functions used by |map| don't need to deal with Signal
% objects as they only get called with a signal's _value_. 
%
% What if your function expects single but your input signal's value is a
% double?  Simply typecast it with |map|!
B = A.map(@single).map(@myfunc);

%%%
% The value of A is called on |single| and its output is then called on
% |myfunc|. You'll notice that many Signals methods can be chained in this
% way, which is convient for writing one-liners.  If your line becomes too
% long or difficult to read you can also split it across a number of lines:
B = A.map(@single);
B = B.map(@myfunc); 

%%% Anonymous functions
% Sometimes your Signal must be in a different positional argument.  For
% this we simply create an anonymous function and use that.  See the
% <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html
% MATLAB doumentation> for more information on how to use these.
delta = A.map(@(A) diff(A,1,2)); % Take 1st order difference over 2nd dimension
a = A.map(@(A) sum(A,2)); % Take sum over 2nd dimension

%%%
% You may have noticed that our other example can be written using an
% anonymous function as a wrapper so that |map| is called just once:
B = A.map(@(v) myfunc(single(v)));
%%%
% Any of these variants will work just fine and there is no real atvantage
% to which one you choose, however if you need to access the intemediate
% value (i.e. single(v), it is better to use the former example.

%%% Example 2: a complex counter
% In the following example we have a signal, responseType, that may be an
% element of [-1 0 1].  A response type of 0 means the trial timed out
% before the subject gave a response.  Let's say we want to count the
% number of times in a row a trial timeout occurs:

% First we store the responseType values for up to the last 1000 trials
timeOuts = responseType.bufferUpTo(1000);
% Then count the number of recent timeouts that occured in a row using an
% anonymous function that works on this array with find and sum:
timeOutCount = timeOuts.map(@(x) sum(x(find([1 x~=0],1,'last'):end) == 0));

%%% Sampling with map
% Map is particularly handy for 'sampling' functions, that is, for
% generating a new index, value, or whatever, each time an event occurs.
% Below we derive a signal, 'side', that each time 'newTrial' updates takes
% a new value from [-1 1].  Note that the anonymous function discards the
% value of 'newTrial'.  We're only using it as a way to trigger the
% evaluation of this function.
newTrial = sig.test.create;
side = newTrial.map(@(~) sign(rand-0.5));

%% at
% The method |at| will sample the value of a Signal each time another
% Signal updates. What's more, the Signal that updates must evaluate to
% true:
x = sig.test.sequence(1:1:100, 0.15); % An linear function
y = sig.test.sequence(sin(1:.1:20), 0.1, 'name', 'y'); % A sine wave
z = x.at(y > .5); % sample the values of x when the values of y > 0.5

sig.test.timeplot(x, y, z, 'mode', [2,2,1], 'tWin', 20); % plot over 20 secs
%%%
% 
% <<./images/at_example3.png>>
% 
% It's very important to remember that the new signal will only update when
% the second input updates and is true (so long as the first input has a
% value to sample).  For the value to be true, it must not be equal to 0.
% In other words, |y = x.at(updatedAndNonZero)|. As you can see 'z' keeps
% updating each time 'y' updates, even when 'x' stops updating (c.f.
% |keepWhen| method below).

%% then
% There is another method called |then| which works the same way as |at|,
% but with the inputs in a reverse order.  This is simply to make things
% more self-documenting.
updatedAndTrue = y.at(updated);
updatedAndTrue = updated.then(y); % These two lines are equivalent

%% Mapping constants
% Sometimes you want to derive a Signal whose value is always constant but
% nevertheless updates depending on another Signal, thus acting as a
% trigger for something.  This can be achieved by using a constant value
% instead of a function in |map|.  For example below we produce a signal
% that is always mapped to true and updates whenever its dependent value
% updates.
seq = repmat(-2:2, 1, 5);
x = sig.test.sequence(seq, 0.2); % Create a sequence
y = x.at(x); % Zero values are ignored
updated = x.map(true); % Updates to true each time x updates
z = x.at(updated); % All values map to true

ax = sig.test.timeplot(x, y, z, 'mode', [0,1,1]);
%%%
% 
% <<./images/at_example2.png>>
% 
% The above example is simply to demonstrate that you can map a value to
% 'true' when we care about the 'when' of a signal than the 'what'.  In the
% above code x and z do the same thing, but would be useful when you want
% to sampling one signal each time differnt signal updates, e.g.
updated = y.map(true);
z = x.at(updated);

%%%
% Note that if the input arg is a value rather than a function handle, it
% is truely constant, even if it's the output of a function:
c = x.map(rand); % use constant value of rand each times x updates
rnd = x.map(@(~)rand); % call rand each time x updates
%%%
% The tilda here means that the value of Signal x is ignored, instead of
% being assigned to a temporary variable or being mapped into the functon
% |rand|, thus |rand| is called with no arguments.

%% keepWhen
% Another method for filtering signals is |keepWhen|.  This will keep the
% value of one signal so long as another signal evaluates true (i.e. is
% non-zero).
x = sig.test.sequence(1:15, 0.25); % Create a sequence
isEven = mod(floor(x), 2) == 0; % True when x is an even number
y = x.keepWhen(isEven); % Sample x when x is even

ax = sig.test.timeplot(x, y, 'mode', 1);
%%%
% 
% <<./images/keepWhen_example.png>>
% 
% What's the difference between |keepWhen| and |at| / |then|?  These two
% methods essentially do that same thing, however the result of |keepWhen|
% will update each time its first input updates, so long as its second
% input is non-zero.  
x = sig.test.sequence(1:1:100, 0.25); % A linear function updating every 1/4 second
y = sig.test.sequence(sin(1:.1:20), 0.1, 'name', 'y'); % A sine wave updating every 100ms

% z = x.at(y > .5); % z stops when y stops updating
z = x.keepWhen(y > .5); % z stops when x stops updating
sig.test.timeplot(x, y, z, 'mode', [2,2,1], 'tWin', 20);

%%%
% Try playing with the update times and using |at| vs |keepWhen|

%% skipRepeats
% |skipRepeats| creates a signal that only updates when its input updates
% with an unique value.  That is, when its input updates with a value that
% is different to the previous one.  It is important to realize that
% signals can repeatedly update with the same value, and each time a signal
% updates it can cause other signals to update depending on how you define
% them.  Below is an example of |skipRepeats|:
seq = [0 0 2 2 0 0 -2 -2 0 0 0];
x = sig.test.sequence(seq, 0.45);
y = skipRepeats(x);

sig.test.timeplot(x, y);
%%%
% 
% <<./images/skipRepeats_example1.png>>
% 

%% A signal that updates only once
% In this next example we show how to define a signal that updates once and
% only once.  Remember that signals generally update whenever any of their
% inputs update.  Sometimes you want to use a value such as a user defined
% parameter to calculate something, but you don't want it to change at all.
x = sig.test.sequence(0:9, 0.5);
y = x.map(true).skipRepeats.then(x);

sig.test.timeplot(x, y, 'mode', 1);
%%%
% 
% <<./images/once_example.png>>
% 
%%% 
% Here is a similar example: update once and only once, when x is zero
x = sig.test.sequence(-4:4, 0.5);
y = x.keepWhen(x == 0).skipRepeats;

sig.test.timeplot(x, y, 'mode', 1);

%% A note about syntax
% When we type something like |A.map(pi)| we are actually calling the
% method |map| on the object |A|.  A method is another word for a function
% associated with an object.  Signals are objects, and so far we've looked
% at various methods (i.e. functions) that work with them.  In MATLAB there
% are two ways of calling a method on an object, one is the traditional way
% e.g. |func(obj)| and the other is the 'dot syntax' way: |obj.func()|.
% These are the same, and you can use them interchangeably so long as 'obj'
% is a Signal (and not something else, like a double or logical).  Below
% are pairs of lines that are equivalent:
S = sig.test.create; % create a Signal object

S = S.map(pi); % Map values of S -> pi, e.g. when S updates, return pi
S = map(S, pi);

S = S.then(true); % When S updates and is true, return true
S = then(S, true);

%% mapn
% |mapn| takes any number of inputs where the last argument is the function
% that the other arguments are mapped to.  The arguments may be any
% combination of signals and normal data types.  It's important to note
% that the below 'dot notation' only works if the first input is a Signal,
% otherwise you must use the traditional syntax e.g. |mapn(5, A, @f)|
B = A.mapn(n, 1, @repmat); % repmat(A,n,1)

%%%
% *NB*: |map| will only assign the first output argument of the function to
% the resulting Signal.  Mapping to a variable number of output Signals is
% only possible with mapn:
a = sig.test.create; % if a = rand(1,1,3,1,2)
[b, n] = a.mapn(@shiftdim); % b is 3-by-1-by-2 and n is 2.
c = b.mapn(-n, @shiftdim);  % c == a.
d = a.mapn(3, @shiftdim);   % d is 1-by-2-by-1-by-1-by-3.

%% map2
% If you have exactly two inputs to a function you can also used |map2|.
% This method behaves identically to |mapn| but can apply a function to
% only two inputs.  Also |map2| cannot create more than one resulting
% signal.

% Load an image from a directory of images with the name pattern imgN.mat:
imgArr = imgIdx.map2(imgDir, ...
  @(num,dir)loadVar(fullfile(dir, ['img', num2str(num), '.mat']), 'img'));

%% scan
% |scan| is a very powerful method that allows one to map a signal's
% current value and its previous value through a function.  This allows one
% to define signals that have some sort of history to them. This is similar
% to the fold or reduce functions found in other functional programming
% applications.
%
% Below we take the value of |x| and return a value that is the
% accumulation of |x| by using |scan| with the function |plus|.  The third
% argument to |scan| here is the initial, or 'seed', value.  Because the
% seed is zero, the first time |x| takes a value, |scan| maps zero and the
% value of |x| respectively to the plus function and assigns the output to
% Signal |y|. The second time |x| updates, scan maps the current value of
% |y|, our accumulated value, and the new value of |x| to the plus
% function.

x = sig.test.sequence(ones(1:10), 0.5);
y = x.scan(@plus, 0); % plus(y, x), or y + x

sig.test.timeplot(x, y);
%%%
% 
% <<./images/scan_example1.png>>
% 

%% The seed value may be a signal
% As with other Signals methods, any of the inputs except the function
% handle may be a Signal.  This is particularly useful as the seed value
% can act as a reset of the accumulator as demonstrated below.

x = sig.test.sequence(1:10, 0.5);
seed = sig.test.sequence([0 0], 2.5, 'name', 'seed');
y = x.scan(@plus, seed);

sig.test.timeplot(x, y, seed, 'mode', [0 0 1]);
%%%
% 
% <<./images/scan_example2.png>>
% 

%% Growing an array with scan
% You can grow arrays with scan by using the vertcat or horzcat functions.
% The accumulated/seed value is always the first argument to the function,
% however, you can of course assign them to temporary variables beforehand
% as below.

x = sig.test.sequence('olleh', 1);
f = @(acc,itm) [itm acc]; % Prepend char to array
y = x.scan(f, '!');

sig.test.timeplot(x, y); % Plot values
h = output(y); % Post value to command prompt
%%%
% 
% <<./images/scan_example3.png>>
% 

%%%
% Below, each time the Signal 'correct' takes a new, truthy value, the
% Signal 'trialSide' updates and scan will call the function horzcat with
% the values of hist and trialSide like so: |horzcat(hist, trialSide)|,
% which is syntactically equivalent to [hist trialSide]
%  hist = trialSide.at(correct).scan(@horzcat);

%% Example: finding the max with scan
% In this example we use scan to find the maximum value in a signal's
% history.  The logic is simple: each time signal 'x' updates we compare
% our previous max value with the new one and save whichever is bigger.
%
% Let x be an amplitude modulated signal defined as:
%
% $c(t) = A(t)sin(2\pi f_{c} t)$
%
f_c = 8; % Carrier frequency in Hz
t = 0:1/1000:0.5; % Determine time values at 1000 Hz sampling rate
A = t % Information signal (linear function)

% Define AM signal
AM = A.*sin(2*pi*f_c*t);
x = sig.test.sequence(AM, 0.1);

peak = x.scan(@max, -Inf).skipRepeats();

sig.test.timeplot(x, peak, 'mode', [2, 1], 'tWin', 60);

% 

%% Introducing extra parameters
% Some functions require any number of extra inputs.  A function can be
% called with these extra parameters by defining them after the 'pars' name
% argument.  All arguments after the input 'pars' are treated as extra
% parameters to map to the function when either the input or seed Signals
% update. 
x = net.origin('x');
seed = net.origin('seed');
seed.post('!'); % Initialize seed with value
f = @(acc,itm,p1) [itm p1 acc]; % Prepend char to array
y = x.scan(f, seed, 'pars', '.'); % Pars may be signals or no
h = y.output();

x.post('>')

%% Parameters may be Signals
% Below we use the scan function to build a character array with strjoin...

x = net.origin('x');
seed = net.origin('seed');
seed.post('0'); % Initialize seed with value
f = @(acc,itm,delim) strjoin({acc, itm}, delim); % Prepend char to array
% f = @(acc,itm) strjoin({acc, itm}, ' + '); 
y = x.scan(f, seed, 'pars', ' + '); % Pars may be signals or any other data type
h = y.output();

x.post('1')
x.post('12')
x.post('18')
x.post('5')
x.post('8')

%% When pars take new values, accumulator function is not called!
% Unlike most other Signals, parameters Signals can take new values
% without causing the function to be called.  Below we define a Signal, p,
% into which we can post the delimiter for the function strjoin.
x = sig.test.sequence(randi(10,1,5), 1); % Some random numbers from 1-10
p = sig.test.sequence('+-', 1, 'name', 'op'); % Some operators
init = '0'; % The seed value
f = @(acc,itm,delim) strjoin({acc, num2str(itm)}, delim); % Prepend char to array
y = x.scan(f, init, 'pars', p); % Pars may be signals or any other data type

h = y.output(); % Output to the command window
sig.test.timeplot(x, p, y); % Plot values
%%% Plot output
% 
% <<./images/scan_example5.png>>
% 
%%% Command output
%     0+1
%     0+1-10
%     0+1-10-8
%     0+1-10-8-8
%%%
% Note that y can not update until all its inputs have values (i.e. we
% don't see a value until p updates). 

%% Scan can call any number of functions at the same time
% Scan can call any number of functions each time one of the input
% Signals updates.  Only the functions whose named inputs update will be
% called.  Remember that all functions called by scan have the accumulated
% value as their first input argument, followed by the input Signal and any
% parameters following the 'pars' input.
x = net.origin('x');
y = net.origin('y');
z = net.origin('z');
seed = net.origin('seed');
seed.post(0); % Initialize seed with value
f1 = @plus; %
f2 = @minus; %
f3 = @times; %
v = scan(x, f1, y, f2, z, f3, seed); % Pars may be signals or any other data type
h = v.output();

x.post(1) % 1
x.post(1) % 2

%% delta

y = delta(x);

sig.test.timeplot(x, y, 'mode', 2);
%%%

% 

%% lag
% |lag| delays a signal by a given number of samples.  To delay by a given
% amount of time, use |delay|.  The number of samples you delay by must be
% a whole number and cannot be a signal.  The derived signal will only
% update once the input signal has updated the minimum number of times.
% That is, given |b = a.lag(5)|, 'b' will get its first value _after_ 'a'
% has updated five times.  
%
% In the below example we define a sine wave signal, then derive a signal
% that lags by a quarter of a period.  Plotting these two against each
% other results in a circle.
f = 2; % Frequency in Hz
Fs = 100; % Samples per second
t = 0 : 1/Fs : 2/f; % 2 periods

x = sin(2*pi*f*t); % A sine wave
x = sig.test.sequence(x, .1); % Update every 100ms

% Derive a signal that lags by T/4 samples
y = x.lag(round(Fs/(4*f))); 

sig.test.timeplot(x, y, 'mode', 2, 'tWin', 10); % Plot vs time
sig.test.plot(x, y, 'k-'); % Plot x vs y

% Below is a way of defining when a response is made during a trial:

% clickTimes specifies the times at which clicks should occur, based on click rate and duraion
% quiescentDuration chooses the length of the quiescent period for the tiral

trialTimeout = skipRepeats((t-(at(t,stimPeriodStart)) > p.responseWindow)*(p.responseWindow>0));
responseMade = closedLoopStart.setTrigger(abs(wheelMovement)>=60 | trialTimeout);


%% sig.quiescenceWatch
% The function |sig.quiescenceWatch| is much like |setTrigger|, but both
% the value and the update time are criteria.

%% merge
% The |merge| method takes any number of inputs and returns the value of
% the last updated input.  

% Here we create four signals that each update in staggered fashion:
x = sig.test.sequence([1 1], 1, 'delay', 1); % Update once per second after a second
a = sig.test.sequence(2, 1, 'name', 'a', 'delay', 2); % Update after 2 seconds
b = sig.test.sequence(3, 1, 'name', 'b', 'delay', 3); % Update after 3 seconds

y = a*x^2 + b*x;

z = merge(x, a, y, b);

sig.test.timeplot(x, a, b, y, z, 'mode', 1, 'tWin', 3);

%%%
% 
% <<./images/merge_example.png>>
% 
%%%
%
% Unlike most other signals, |merge| signals update when any of their
% inputs updates, regardless of whether all their inputs have a value.  The
% order of the inputs is significant: when two signals update
% simultaneously the value of the input that comes earlier in the list is
% selected.  In the above example 'b' and 'y' update simultaneously (when
% 'b' updates all of the inputs to 'y' have a value, so 'y' updates).
% Because 'y' comes before 'b' in the merge list, 'z' takes the value of
% 'y' rather than 'b'.
%
% If you want the merged signal to update only after all signals have a
% value, you can use the following:

% Because [a b c] requires all three inputs to have a value, it will only
% start to take values when all are initialized.  Then each time an input
% updates, allUpdated will update to true, this then samples the current
% value of the merge signal for s
allUpdated = map([a b c], true);
s = allUpdated.then(merge(a, b, c));

%% delay
% The |delay| method produces a signal that updates a given number of
% seconds after its input.  As with |lag|, the number you delay by must be
% a double and not a Signal object.

emitter = sig.test.sequence([-1 -1 0 3 4 4 5], 0.5);

x = emitter.skipRepeats;
y = x.delay(1);

sig.test.timeplot(x, y, 'mode', 1)

%%%
% 
% <<./images/delay_example.png>>
% 

%% Notes
% (1) If a signal already has a value and you derive a new signal from it,
% the new signal won't automatically compute its value.  In the Signals
% Experiment Framework, the experiment definition function is run once to
% set up all Signals, before any inputs are posted into the network, so
% this isn't an issue.
%
% (2) You can get the number of nodes in the network by calling
% |networkInfo| on the net id:
networkInfo(a.Node.Net.Id)
%%%
%  Net 0 with 9/4000 active nodes
%%%
%
% (3) As you may have noticed from the node graphs, when you evaluate an
% expression involving a signal, any numbers are made into Signal objects.
% These are nodes that only ever have one value (known as 'root' nodes).
% There are often more nodes in a network than you might expect, for
% example the following line indicates that there are at least 4 nodes in
% the network:
x = mod(floor(x), 1*2)
%%%
% These would be |x|, |2| (a root node), |floor(x)| and |mod(floor(x), 2)|.
%
% (4) When a function is called on an object, MATLAB checks whether that
% object's class has a method of the same name (a 'method' is a function
% that is part of an object's class).  If the class has that method
% associated with it, this method is called instead of the usual function.
% This is known as 'overloading' and is how we can do things like adding
% and subtracting Signals.  For more info, see the MATLAB documentation
% <https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/overloading-functions-for-your-class.html
% here>.
%
% (5) This is known as 'syntactic sugar', and a list of MATLAB's operators
% and the functions they correspond to can be found
% <https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/matlab-operators-and-special-characters.html
% here>.

%% Summary
% Here are the most important things to remember when writing an
% experiment:
% 
% # Signals represent values that change can over time.
% # Evaluating any expression that includes a signal will result in a new
% signal being returned, e.g. is 'a' is a signal, 'a * 2' produces a new
% signal.
% # In general a signal can only update when all of its inputs have a
% value.
% # Clearing or reassigning a variable is different to deleting or
% modifying a signal.
% # Signals can have any value type: if one of your signals changes data
% type, make sure all dependent signals can work with those types.
