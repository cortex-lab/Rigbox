When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via creation of a [github issue](https://github.com/cortex-lab/Rigbox/issues). Thereafter, contributors should create a new 'feature' branch (branched off of the 'dev' branch) for any changes/additions they wish to make, and then create a pull request for merging this feature branch into 'dev'. If making a change to a submodule, a pull request should be sent to that submodule's repository. (e.g. if a user is making a change to a file within the signals repository, a pull request should be made to the [signals repository](https://github.com/cortex-lab/signals/pulls), not to the Rigbox repository.) **TLDR: All feature branches should be branched off of 'dev', and pull requests should be made to 'dev'. If making a change to a submodule, send the pull request to the 'dev' branch of that submodule's repository.** 

All pull requests will be reviewed by the project maintainers. Detailed information on the guidelines the project maintainers follow when developing code and reviewing pull requests can be found [here](https://github.com/cortex-lab/Rigbox/tree/master/docs/maintainers/Maintainer_Guidelines.md).

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
maintainers and contributors pledge to make participation in our project and
our community an enjoyable and harassment-free experience for everyone.

### Our Standards

include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior, and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions, particularly those
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. 

Project maintainers may ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that are deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement
