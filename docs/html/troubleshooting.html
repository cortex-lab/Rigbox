##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Troubleshooting
% Often finding the source of a problem seems daunghting when faced with a
% huge Rigbox error stack.  Below are some tips on how to quickly get to
% the root of the issue and hopefully solve it.


%%% Update the code
% Check what version of the code you're using and that you're up-to-date:
git.runCmd('status'); % Tells me what branch I'm on
git.update(0); % Update now

% If you're on a development or feature branch try moving to the master
% branch, which should be most stable.  
git.runCmd('checkout master'); git.update(0);


%%% Examining the stack
% Don't be frightened by a wall of red text!  Simply start from the top and
% work out what the errors might mean and what part of code they came from.
% The error at the top is the one that ultimately caused the crash.  Try to
% determine if this is a MATLAB builtin function, e.g. 
%
%   Warning: Error occurred while executing the listener callback for event UpdatePanel defined for class eui.SignalsTest:
%   Error using griddedInterpolant
%   Interpolation requires at least two sample points in each dimension.
% 
%   Error in interp1 (line 151)
%   F = griddedInterpolant(X,V,method);
%
%   TODO Add better example of builtin errors
%
% If you're debugging a signals experiment definition, check for the line
% in your experiment where this particular builtin function was called. NB:
% You can check whether it is specific to your experiment by running one of
% the example experiment definitions such as advancedChoiceWorld.m, found
% in signals/docs/examples.  If this runs without error then you're problem
% may be specific to your experiment.  You should see the name of your
% definition function and exp.SignalsExp in the stack if they are involved.
%
% If you don't know what a function is, try checking the documentation.
% Consider the following:
%
%  Error using open
%  Invalid number of channels
%
%  Error in audstream.fromSignal (line 16)
%    id = audstream.open(sampleRate, nChannels, devIdx);
%  [...]
%
% If you're unsure what `audstream.fromSignal` does, try typing `doc
% audstream`.  This should tell you that the package deals with audio
% devices in signals.  In this case the issue might be that your audio
% settings are incorrect.  Take a look at the audio section of
% `docs\setup\hardware_config.m` and see if you can setup your audio
% devices differently.


%%% Paths
% By far the most common issue in Rigbox relates to problems with the
% MATLAB paths.  Check the following:
% 
% # Do you have a paths file in the +dat package?
%  Check the location by running `which dat.paths`.  Check that a file is
%  on the paths and that it's the correct one.
% # Check the paths set in this file.
%  Run `p = dat.paths` and inspect the output.  Perhaps a path is set
%  incorrectly for one of the fields.  Note that custom rig paths overwrite
%  those written in your paths file.  More info found in
%  `using_dat_package` and `paths_template`.
% # Do you have path conflicts?  
%  Make sure MATLAB's set paths don't include other functions that have the
%  same name as Rigbox ones.  Note that any functions in ~/Documents/MATLAB
%  take precedence over others.  If you keep seeing the following warning
%  check that you've set the paths correctly: 
%   Warning: Function system has the same name as a MATLAB builtin. We
%   suggest you rename the function to avoid a potential name conflict.
%  This warning can occur if the tests folder has been added to the paths
%  by mistake.  Always set the paths by running `addRigboxPaths` and never
%  set them manually as some folders should not be visible to MATLAB.
% # Check your working directory
%  MATLAB prioritizes functions found in your working directory over any
%  others in your path list so try to change into a 'safe' folder before
%  re-running your code:
%   pwd % display working directory
%   cd ~/Documents/MATLAB
% # Check your variable names
%  Make sure your variable names don't shadow a function or package in
%  Rigbox, for instance if in an experiment definition you create a varible
%  called `vis`, you will no longer be able to access functions in the +vis
%  package from within the function:
%   vis = 23;
%   img = vis.image(t);
%   Error: Reference to non-existent field 'image'.


%%% Reverting
% If these errors only started occuring after updating the code,
% particularly if you hadn't updated in a long time, try reverting to the
% previous version of the code.  This can help determine if the update
% really was the culprit and will allow you to keep using the code on
% outdated machines.  Previous stable releases can be found on the Github
% page under releases.  NB: For the most recent stable code always pull
% directly from the master branch


%%% Posting an issue on Github
% If you're completely stumped, open an issue on the Rigbox Github page (or
% alyx-matlab if you think it's related to the Alyx database).  When
% creating an issue, read the bug report template carefully and be sure to
% provide as much information as possible.
%
% If you tracked down the problem but found the error to be confusing or
% too vague, feel free to post a feature request describing how better to
% present the error.  This is an area in need of improvment. You could also
% make a change yourself and submit a pull request.  For more info see
% CONTRIBUTING.md


%% FAQ
% Below are some frequently asked questions and suggestions for fixing
% them.  Note there are plenty of other FAQs in the various setup scripts
% with more specific information.
