%% Introduction
% Timeline outputs are useful for triggering external hardware, but what
% about notifying other software of an experiment?  Services in Rigbox
% allow one to trigger software on other devices, including starting and
% stopping Timeline if it is running on a separate computer.  Services are
% simply objects that send UDP messages at various times during an
% experiment.  

%% The Service class
% Service classes have at least two methods, |start| and |stop|.  At the
% beginning of an experiment |srv.expServer| will load these services
% objects and run the |start| method for each, likewise at the send on an
% experiment the |stop| method is called.  This provides a flexible way to
% perform custom tasks during an experiment, and is technically not limited
% to triggering software with UDPs: if you wanted you could create your own
% subclass that does something entirely different, such as opening a file
% or running system commands. 
doc srv.Service

%% Workflow
% The sequence of events leading up to services starting is somewhat
% convoluted!
%
% When |srv.expServer| receives a messages from MC to begin a new
% experiment it first starts Timeline locally (if required), then calls
% |srv.prepareExp| which initializes the experiment, then calls
% |srv.findService| with a list of services to be started.
% |srv.findService| loads |srv.basicServices| which loads all configured
% service objects.  |srv.findService| returns all requested services to
% |srv.prepareExp|, which creates stores them in both an
% |exp.StartServices| and |exp.StopServices| object.  These objects are
% added as callbacks to the experimentInit event.  |srv.expServer| now
% calls |run| on the experiment object, which during in turn triggers the
% experimentInit event, whereby the Service objects send their UDPs to
% start the auxillary software.  Below is the stack starting at #1 and
% going down, left to right:

%
%% Customising your services
% The services are created by |expServer| at the start of the experiment.
% It calls the function |srv.findService| which in turn calls the function
% |srv.basicServices|.  Either of these files may be edited to configure
% the services you need.  
%
% A simple way of doing this is to create a folder named |+srv| in the
% MATLAB folder (usually found in ~\Documents). Anything in this folder
% appears at the top of the your paths and therefor you can shadow Rigbox's
% default |basicServices| function with the one you create in the MATLAB
% folder.  This way your modified function won't be affected by pulls from
% Git. 
%
% Your |srv.basicServices| function should have the host names for each
% service as input and ouput a cell array of |srv.Service| objects:
% function [services] = basicServices(timelineHost, neuralImgHost, eyeTrackingHost)
%
% Let's have a look at configuring some services with the
% |srv.PrimitiveUDPService| subclass.  This used |pnet|, a networking
% function that comes with PsychToolbox to sent and recieve UDP messages:

% Configure scanimage/neural acquisition service
% The class is called with the remote computer's host name.
neuralImg = srv.PrimitiveUDPService(neuralImgHost);
% The title is something human-readable that will be used in command window
% status updates
neuralImg.Title = 'Neural imaging';
% The id must match the name stored in your StimulusControl object (more on
% this later)
neuralImg.Id = 'neural-imaging';
% The response timeout in seconds.  If the remote devices fails to respond
% in this time, expServer with throw an error and the experiment won't
% start.
neuralImg.ResponseTimeout = 5;
% The listen and remote ports may also be set either here are as positional
% arguments to the constructor.  The defaults are 10000.
neuralImg.RemotePort = 10000;

services = {timeline neuralImg eyeTracking}; % Our example output

%% Primative UDP Service
% The service is started by calling the |start| method with an experiment
% reference string:
ref = dat.constructExpRef('fake', now, 1);
neuralImg.start(ref)

% The object sends the message GOGO<ref>*<host> where <ref> is the
% experiment reference and <host> is the hostname.  The remote computer is
% expected to echo message within the timeout period.  It is printed to the
% command window. 

% Calling stop is similar:
neuralImg.stop(ref) % Send STOP*<host>
% The message should be echoed back

% The is also a status method.  When the property Status is accessed the
% following message is sent:
status = neuralImg.Status; % Send WHAT814724*<host>
%
% The same random number is expected to be returned along with the status,
% e.g.
% GOGO814724 % means device running

%% Basic UDP Service
% Another subclass is called |srv.basicUDPService|.  This is similar to
% |primativeUDPService| however it is a little more flexible and uses
% MATLAB's instrument control toolbox.  It can also send messages
% asynchronously.
doc srv.basicUDPService

% Below is a configuration for starting a remote computer that controls
% some galvo moters during an experiment:

% Some default hosts
if nargin < 1 
  galvoHost = 'zimbabwe';
end
% Configure galvo service
galvo = srv.BasicUDPService(galvoHost, 10002, 10000);
galvo.Title = sprintf('Galvo on %s', galvoHost);
galvo.Id = 'galvo';
galvo.ResponseTimeout = 5;

services = {galvo};

% The messages sent by this class are similar to those of
% srv.PrimativeUDPService.

%% MPEP UDP Data Hosts
% Finally there is also a subclass called |io.MpepUDPDataHosts|(1).  This
% class can also pass around an instance of Alyx via UDP, allowing remote
% computers to register their files to the Alyx database.  Again, unlike
% |srv.PrimativeUDPService| which sends and receives messages
% synchronously, |io.MpepUDPDataHosts| sends the start and stop messages to
% all remote hosts one after the other without waiting for responses.
%
% Below is some example code.  Note that this code is found in
% |srv.findService|, rather than |srv.basicServices|, which has `id` as its
% first input argument, which matches the Id property of a Service:
timelineHost = iff(any(strcmp(id, 'timeline')), {'zcamp3'}, {''});
neuralImgHost = iff(any(strcmp(id, 'b-scope')), {'zscope'}, {''});
eyeTrackingHost = iff(any(strcmp(id, 'eye-tracking')), {'zquad'}, {''});

remoteHosts = [timeHost neuralImgHost eyeTrackingHost];
emp = cellfun(@isempty, remoteHosts);

MpepHosts = io.MpepUDPDataHosts(remoteHosts(~emp));
MpepHosts.ResponseTimeout = 30;
MpepHosts.Id = 'MPEP-Hosts';
MpepHosts.Title = 'mPep Data Acquisition Hosts';
MpepHosts.open();
s = {MpepHosts};

% The messages sent by this class are different to the others.  With this
% object you can send an instance of Alyx with the start command.  Below
% are a selection of messages sent at the start of an experiment:

% Ping
obj.broadcast('hello');
% Send Alyx instance UDP
UDP_msg = Alyx.parseAlyxInstance(expRef, ai);
[subject, seriesNum, expNum] = dat.expRefToMpep(expRef);
alyxmsg = sprintf('alyx %s %d %d %s', subject, seriesNum, expNum, UDP_msg);
confirmedBroadcast(obj, alyxmsg);
% Send ExpStart UDP
expStartMsg = sprintf('ExpStart %s %d %d', subject, seriesNum, expNum);
confirmedBroadcast(obj, expStartMsg);
% Send the BlockStart UDP
blockStartMsg = sprintf('BlockStart %s %d %d 1', subject, seriesNum, expNum);

% There are also methods for ending stimulus start and status messages.
% Note that the order in which the devices are started is sometimes
% important, particularly if you many inter-connected devices.  For example
% you may have a camera that is triggered by Timeline's Clock Output and
% some camera software is programmed to start saving the frames to file
% after receiving a UDP:

% expServer       Computer A               Computer B
% REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH
% Service REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> Timeline.start() REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-> [trigger camera]
%                       |                       |
% Service <REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHstartedREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH|                       |
%                                               |
% Service REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-> start(eye-tracking) <REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-
%                       |
% Service <REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-started-|

%% Selecting services
% Once you have set up your devices you need to add them to your rig's
% |StimulusControl| object.  This is the object MC uses to access
% information about availiable stimulus computers.
doc srv.StimulusControl

% One of the properties of this object is Services.  Here you can list all
% the configured services for that rig.  This must match the Id properties
% of the services:
sc = srv.stimulusControllers % Load our StimulusControl objects
sc(1).Services = {'neural-imaging', 'eye-tracking', 'timeline'};

% These appear as toggles in the 'rig options' dialog in MC, allowing you
% to select which services you need starting for a given experiment.  You
% can also set the default state by changing the SelectedServices property:
sc(1).SelectedServices = [false, false, true]; % Only timeline on by default

% Setting default delays is sometimes useful.  These can also be changed in
% the 'rig options' dialog in MC.  The ExpPreDelay property is the time in
% seconds to wait between starting the services and actually beginning the
% experiment (for a Signals experiment this means updating the
% 'events.expStart' signal).  This can be useful when a service takes some
% time to initialize, or if you want to record some sort of baseline
% activity before the first stimulus appears.  
sc(1).ExpPreDelay = 10; % Send the start message to services then wait 10s

% Likewise the ExpPostDelay is the time in seconds between the experiment
% ending (i.e. the events.expStop signal updating), and the stop command
% being sent to the services.  This may be useful if you wish to record
% some baseline after the stimulus presentation has ended for example.
sc(1).ExpPostDelay = 30; % Wait 30s then send the stop message to services

% Save your objects:
stimulusControllers = sc; % Variable must be saved as stimulusControllers
save(fullfile(p.globalConfig, 'remote.mat'), 'stimulusControllers')

% More information can be found in the <./websocket_config.html
% websocket_config> script:
open(fullfile(getOr(dat.paths,'rigbox'), ...
  'docs', 'setup', 'websocket_config.m'))

%% Conclusion
% Ultimately the way you configure your services will be idiosyncratic as
% it depends on what devices you need to trigger and what information they
% require from the experiment.  Hopefully the above gives you a good enough
% idea of the ways in which you can integrate other equipment and devices
% into Rigbox.

%% Notes
% (1) MPEP is another, passive stimulus presentation toolbox that predates
% Rigbox.  The functions |io.MpepUDPDataHosts| and |tl.mpepListener| /
% |tl.bindMpepServer| were designed to work with both Rigbox and MPEP.  The
% latter is the function we run on the receiving end.
