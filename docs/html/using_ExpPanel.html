##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Introduction
% ExpPanels are panels under the Experiment > Current tab of mc that
% display information about events occuring during an experiment.  This
% document contains information on how to set up an ExpPanel for
% customizing the monitoring of an Experiment.

%% exp.ExpPanel
% The base class for the ExpPanel is the |exp.ExpPanel|.  All subclasses
% chain a call to this class.
%
% When starting a new experiment in MC a new ExpPanel is created by calling
% the static contructor method `live`:
% 
%   p = live(parent, ref, remoteRig, paramsStruct, activateLog)
%   doc eui.ExpPanel/live
% 
% The precise subclass used depends on the `type` parameter in the
% paramsStruct input.  Currently supported types include
% SingleTargetChoiceWorld, ChoiceWorld, DiscWorld, SurroundChoiceWorld
% (|eui.ChoiceExpPanel|); BarMapping (|eui.MappingExpPanel|); custom a.k.a.
% Signals (|eui.SignalsExpPanel|).  
%
% For Signals experiments the default ExpPanel class may be overridden by
% providing a parameter named `expPanelFun` whose value is either a
% function handle for an ExpPanel constructor or path to the class to be
% instantiated.  This parameter is automatically added in MC if the folder
% from which the experiment function was loaded contains an ExpPanel.  The
% name must be the same as the experiment function but with 'ExpPanel'
% added, e.g. for 'advancedChoiceWorld.m', the corresponding ExpPanel file
% would be 'advancedChoiceWorldExpPanel.m'.

%% Basic layout
% The ExpPanel has the following basic layout...

%%% Title
% The panel title contains the experiment reference and the name of the
% remote rig.  When the experiment is initializing or during the
% cleanup/post-delay phase the title is amber.  During the main experiment
% phase the title turns green and when complete, red.  This title colour
% and other properties are set in the `live` method then subsequently by
% the `event` method.  The title is stored in the Root.Title property.

%%% InfoGrid
% The info grid contains all experiment event labels and their current
% values.  As new events occur they're added to the last via a call to
% addInfoField.  There are 4 default fields:
%
% * Status - The current experimental phase, e.g. 'Pending', 'Complete'.
%     The status is set based on 'ExpUpdate' events from the remote rig
%     (see the `expUpdate` method).
% * Duration - The time elapsed since the experiment began.  This
%     is updated each time the `update` method is called (every 100ms in
%     MC).
% * Trial count - The total number of trials.  This field is updated based
%     on the 'newTrial' ExpUpdate status (see `expUpdate` method).
% * Condition - The current trial condition.  This only appears if
%     `conditionId` parameter is defined.
%
% The fields may be hidden by right-clicking one and selecting 'Hide
% field'.  The hidden fields may be reset by selecting 'Reset hidden'.

%%% CustomPanel
% A container for subclasses to build plots into.  For example in the
% ChoiceWorld Experiment, this contains a psychometric curve plot and the
% trace of the wheel input.  

%%% CommentsBox
% An input field for taking notes.  These are automatically saved to the
% Log (see |dat.logPath|, |dat.logEntries|).  If logged into Alyx the notes
% are also saved to the database session narrative (see
% |Alyx.updateNarrative|).  The comments box may be hidden by
% right-clicking and selecting 'Hide comments'.

%%% ButtonPanel
% A set of buttons for ending/aborting the experiment as well as viewing
% the parameter set.  If End is pressed, the experiment is ended after the
% post delay, the block's endStatus field is set to 'quit', and ALF files
% may be extracted from the block.  If Abort is pressed, the post delay is
% skipped, the endStatus is set to 'aborted' and no ALF files are extracted
% from the block during save.

%% Method call sequence
% Below is the sequence of method calls.  This is useful to be aware of
% when making your own subclass.
%
%  mc/beginExp
%       |
%  eui.ExpPanel/live
%       |
%  eui._ExpPanel/_ExpPanel (may be a subclass constructor, e.g.
%       |                   SignalsExpPanel)
%  eui._ExpPanel/build (subclasses should chain call to superclass build)
%       |
%  eui.ExpPanel/addInfoField (adds any default info labels, e.g.
%                             TrialCount)
%
%
%  eui._ExpPanel/update (mc timer callback)
%       | (if eui.SignalsExpPanel or subclass. 
%       |  NB: All subclasses should chain a call to superclass update)
%  eui._ExpPanel/processUpdates (method only present in SignalExpPanel
%       |                        classes)
%  eui.ExpPanel/addInfoField (adds any new Signals event fields)

%% exp.SignalsExpPanel
% The subclass, |eui.SignalsExpPanel|, is the default class for Signals
% Experiments.   In this class, all Signals updates are shown as InfoFields
% whose colours pulse green as the values update.  The signals sent from
% the stimulus computer includes events, parameters, inputs and outputs
% signals.  The 'Trial count' field reflects the value of events.trialNum.
%
% The UpdatesFilter property contains a list of signals updates to create a
% label for, or if Exclude == true, all signals names in this list are
% ignored.  This is useful when your events structure is large and you
% don't wish to see all of them during the experiment.
%
% |exp.SignalsExp| periodically(1) sends signals event updates to the |MC|
% computer(2).  These updates trigger the expUpdate method which stores the
% updates in the SignalUpdates property.  All updates in this property are
% delt with and removed by the processUpdates method, which is called via
% the update by the |MC| Refresh timer once per 100ms(3).
%
% The SignalUpdate property is a struct with the following fields:
% 
% * name - The name of the signal, e.g. 'events.newTrial'
% * value - The value of the signal.
% * timestamp - a date vector of the date and time when the signal was
% queued.  (NB: This is in the system time of the remote rig and depends on
% its timezone.  These timestamps aren't as precise as those in the block
% file).
%
% When new updates are processed in |eui.SignalsExpPanel|, if an info field
% does not already exist, one is created.  When the FormatLabels property
% is true the Signals update labels are formatted as sperate words.  For
% example 'events.newTrial' is displayed as 'New trial'.  This flag and
% others such as the UpdatesFilter can be set it your subclass constructor.

%% Custom Signals ExpPanels
% Below is a list of steps to follow when creating a custom Signals
% ExpPanel, for an example of this see advancedChoiceWorldExpPanel(4):
% 
% # Subclass |eui.SignalsExpPanel|
%  Subclassing means you will inherit all of the methods and properties
%  found in |eui.SignalsExpPanel| and |eui.ExpPanel|.
% # Add any extra properties specific to your ExpPanel
%  For example if you're creating a new plot you may wish to store the axes
%  in a property.  (c.f. PsychometricAxes in advancedChoiceWorldExpPanel)
% # Add a constructor to initialize any properties if required
%  Chain a call to the superclass method like so:
%  |obj = obj@eui.SignalsExpPanel(parent, ref, params, logEntry);|
% # Add a build method to initialize an axes or extra UI elements.
%  Typically everything built here will use obj.CustomPanel as the parent
%  container.  This method must have protected access.
%  Chain a call to the superclass method first:
%  |build@eui.SignalsExpPanel(obj, parent);|
% # Add a processUpdates to deal with your experiment-specific events.
%  Here you can add code to update plots, etc. based on the event updates.
%  This method must have protected access.  Instead of chaining a call,
%  copy the code from eui.SignalsExpPanel/processUpdates directly and use
%  it as a template for your own functions.
%
%
% There are some useful superclass methods that are useful to keep in mind:
%
% * mergeTrialData - Update the local block structure with data from the
% last trial.  This is found in eui.ExpPanel.
% * newTrial - This doesn't do anything in the superclasses but is a good
% place to put code that should be executed at events.newTrial.  Call it
% from processUpdates.
% * trialCompleted - As with newTrial, this could be used as a place for
% code that runs after e.g. an outputs or feedback event.
% * expStopped - Useful for executing code when the session ends.  Must
% chain a call to superclass here.
% * expStarted - See above.
% * cleanup - Place code here for e.g. stopping timers, clearing listeners,
% etc.
%
%
% Here are some useful properties to be aware of:
%
% * Parameters - A copy of that experiment's paramStruct.
% * UpdatesFilter - As mentioned above, this holds a cell array of events
% you wish to ignore/include.  It's behaviour depends on whether the
% Exclude property is true or false.
% * RecentColour - The colour of recently updated Signals update events in
% the InfoGrid.  This can be changed dynamically during the session, for
% instance could turn red as the subject's performance declines or towards
% the end of the session.
%
%
% Finally there are some other useful untilities to be aware of:
%
% * +psy - The |psy| package contains useful functions for plotting
% psychometrics and producing fits.
% * |bui.Axes| - This class provides a convenient way to interact with
% plotting axes.  It's particularly useful if you wish to add multple
% elements to the same axes.  Below is an example from advancedChoiceWorld:

obj.ExperimentAxes = bui.Axes(plotgrid); % Create new bui.Axes object
obj.ExperimentAxes.ActivePositionProperty = 'position';
obj.ExperimentAxes.XTickLabel = []; % Remove the X tick labels
obj.ExperimentAxes.NextPlot = 'add'; % Add new plots without clearing axes
% First initialize a plot for the wheel trace and store the resulting axes
obj.ExperimentHands.wheelH = plot(obj.ExperimentAxes,...
  [0 0],...
  [NaN NaN],...
  'Color', .75*[1 1 1]);
% Now initialize a threshold line on the same plot
obj.ExperimentHands.threshL = plot(obj.ExperimentAxes, ...
  [0 0],...
  [NaN NaN],...
  'Color', [1 1 1], 'LineWidth', 4);
% Note that updating plots can be memory intensive, so consider tweaks such
% as updating the underlying plot data instead of clearing and redrawing:
set(obj.ExperimentHands.wheelH,...
  'XData', xx,...
  'YData', tt);
% Also take a look at the drawnow builtin function:
doc drawnow

%% Notes, etc.
% (1) |exp.SignalsExp| sends any new Signals event updates once every 100ms:
% opentoline(which('exp.SignalsExp'), 731, 9)
%
% (2) Any number of computers may listen for these updates, see
% <./websocket_config.html websocket_config>
%
% (3) See |eui.MControl|:
% opentoline(which('eui.MControl'), 84, 7)
%
% (4) The below three lines will open this file:

% rigbox = getOr(dat.paths, 'rigbox'); % Location of Rigbox code
% exampleExps = fullfile(rigbox, 'signals', 'docs', 'examples');
% open(fullfile(exampleExps, 'advancedChoiceWorldExpPanel.m'))
