%% Burgess steering wheel task
% Our laboratory developed a steering wheel setup to probe mouse
% behavior(1). In this setup, a mouse turns a steering wheel with its front
% paws to indicate whether a visual stimulus appears to its left or to its
% right.
%
% This setup is being adopted in multiple laboratories, from Stanford to
% Tokyo, and is being deployed by the International Brain Laboratory.
%
% To facilitate this deployment, we here provide instructions to build the
% setup with components that are entirely off-the-shelf or 3-D printed
%

%% Introduction
% This document gives instructions on how to build a basic version of the
% steering wheel setup to probe mouse behavior, introduced by Burgess et
% al. The goal is to make it easy for other laboratories, including those
% that make the International Brain Laboratory, to replicate the task and
% extend it in various directions. To this end, these instructions rely
% entirely on materials that can be bought off the shelf, or ordered online
% based on 3-D drawings. In this steering wheel setup, we place a steering
% wheel under the front paws of a head-fixed mouse, and we couple the
% wheel's rotation to the horizontal position of a visual stimulus on the
% screens. Turning the wheel left or right moves the stimulus left or
% right. The mouse is then trained to decide whether a stimulus appears on
% its left or its right. Using the wheel, the mouse indicates its choice by
% moving the stimulus to the center. A correct decision is rewarded with a
% drop of water and short intertrial interval, while an incorrect decision
% is penalized with a longer timeout and auditory noise. We use this setup
% throughout our laboratory, and deploy it in training rigs and
% experimental rigs. Training rigs are used to train head-fixed mice on the
% steering-wheel task and acquire behavioral data. Experimental rigs have
% additional apparatus to collect electrophysiological and imaging data,
% measure eye movements and licking activity, provide optogenetic
% perturbations, and so on. Up until recently, constructing these setups
% required a machine shop that could provide custom-made components.
% However, for the purposes of spreading this setup to other laboratories,
% we here describe a new version that does not require a machine shop: all
% components can be ordered online or 3D-printed.

%% Retrieving hardware file path
% The location of the configuration file is set in DAT.PATHS.  If running
% this on the stimulus computer you can use the following syntax:
hardware = fullfile(getOr(dat.paths, 'rigConfig'), 'hardware.mat');

%% Configuring the stimulus window
% The +hw Window class is the main class for configuring the visual
% stimulus window.  It contains the attributes and methods for interacting
% with the lower level functions that interact with the graphics drivers.
% Currently the only concrete implementation is support for the
% Psychophysics Toolbox, the HW.PTB.WINDOW class.

stimWindow = hw.ptb.Window;

%%% ScreenNum
% The Windows screen index to display the stimulus on. If
% Windows detects just one monitor (even if you have more plugged into the
% graphics card), set this to 0 (meaning all screens). Otherwise if you
% want just the primary display (the one with the menu bar), set it to 1;
% secondary to 2, etc.
stimWindow.ScreenNum = 0; % Use all screen


%%% SyncBounds:
% The area over which you can place a photodiode to record stimiulus update
% times. 
% The simplist way to set this is with the POSITIONSYNCREGION method.
% Let's put a 100 px^2 sync square in the top right of the window:
stimWindow.positionSyncRegion('NorthEast', 100, 100)


%%% PxDepth 
% Sets the depth (in bits) of each pixel; default is 32 bits. You can
% usually simply set it based on what the system uses:
stimWindow.PxDepth = Screen('PixelSize', stimWindow.ScreenNum);


%%% OpenBounds 
% The size and position of the window.  When left empty the screen will
% cover the entire screen:
stimWindow.OpenBounds = []; 

%%% MonitorId 
% A handy place to store the make or model of monitor used at that rig.  As
% a copy of the hardware is saved each experiment this may be useful for
% when looking back at old experiments in the future:
stimWindow.MonitorId = 'LG LP097QX1'; % The screens used in Burgess et al.

%% - Performing gamma calibration from command window
%%% Calibration 
% This stores the gamma correction tables (See Below) The simplist way to
% to run the calibration is through SRV.EXPSEERVER once the rest of the
% hardware is configures, however it can also be done via the command
% window, assuming you have an NI DAQ installed:
lightIn = 'ai0'; % The input channel of the photodiode used to measure screen
clockIn = 'ai1'; % The clocking pulse input channel
clockOut = 'port1/line0 (PFI4)'; % The clocking pulse output channel
% Connect the photodiode to `lightIn` and user a jumper to bridge a
% connection between `clockIn` and `clockOut`.

% Make sure the photodiode is placed against the screen before running
stimWindow.Calibration = stimWindow.calibration(DaqDev); % calibration


save(hardware, 'stimWindow', '-append') % Save the stimWindow to file


%% - Signals viewing model
% Signals currently only supports a single viewing odel.  For now the
% function VIS.SCREEN is used to configure this.  Below is an example of
% configuring the viewing model for the Burgess wheel task, where there are
% three small screens located at right-angles to one another:
help vis.screen
% Below is a schematic of the screen configuration (top-down view).  
% ^ represents the observer:
%   _____
%  |     |
%  |  ^  | 

% First define some physical dimentions in cm:
screenDimsCm = [19.6 14.7]; %[width_cm heigh_cm], each screen is the same
centerPt = [0, 0, 9.5] % [x, y, z], observer position in cm. z = dist from screen
centerPt(2,:) = [0, 0, 10]% Middle screen, observer slightly further back
centerPt(3,:) = centerPt; % Observer equidistant from left and right motitors 
angle = [-90; 0; 90]; % The angle of the screen relative to the observer

% Define the pixel dimentions for the monitors
r = Screen('Resolution', stimWindow.ScreenNum) % Returns the current resolution
pxW = r.width; % e.g. 1280
pxH = r.height; % e.g. 1024

% Plug these values into the screens function:
screens(1) = vis.screen(centerPt(1,:), angle(1), screenDimsCm, [0 0 pxW pxH]);        % left screen
screens(2) = vis.screen(centerPt(2,:), angle(2), screenDimsCm, [pxW 0 2*pxW pxH]);    % ahead screen
screens(3) = vis.screen(centerPt(3,:), angle(3), screenDimsCm, [2*pxW  0 3*pxW pxH]); % right screen

save(hardware, 'screens', '-append');

%% Hardware inputs
% In this example we will add two inputs, a DAQ rotatary encoder and a beam
% lick detector.

%% - DAQ rotary encoder
% Create a input for the Burgess LEGO wheel using the HW.DAQROTARYENCODER
% class:
doc hw.DaqRotaryEncoder % More details for this class
mouseInput = hw.DaqRotaryEncoder;

% To deteremine what devices you have installed and their IDs:
daq.getDevices
mouseInput.DaqId = 'Dev1'; % NI DAQ devices are named Dev# by default

% The counter channel which the rotary encoder is connected to:
mouseInput.DaqChannelId = 'ctr0';

% Size of DAQ counter range for detecting over- and underflows (e.g. if
% the DAQ's counter is 32-bit, this should be 2^32).
mouseInput.DaqCounterPeriod = 2^32;

% Setting the encoder resolution and wheel diameter allows us to express
% related experiment parameters in mm and degrees.  These two properties
% are used to calculate the MillimetresFactor property.

% Number of pulses per revolution.  Found at the end of the KÜBLER product
% number, e.g. 05.2400.1122.0100 has a resolution of 100
mouseInput.EncoderResolution = 1024
% Diameter of the wheel in mm
mouseInput.WheelDiameter = 62

%% - Lick detector
% A beam lick detector may be configured to work with an edge counter
% channel.  We can use the HW.DAQEDGECOUNTER class for this:
lickDetector = hw.DaqEdgeCounter;

% This is actually a subclass of the HW.DAQROTARYENCODER class, and
% therefore has a few irrelevant properties such as WheelDiameter.  These
% can be ignored.

% To deteremine what devices you have installed and their IDs:
lickDetector.DaqId = 'Dev1'; % NI DAQ devices are named Dev# by default

% The counter channel which the rotary encoder is connected to:
lickDetector.DaqChannelId = 'ctr1';

% Save these two into our hardware file
save(hardware, 'stimWindow', 'lickDetector', '-append')

%% Hardware outputs
% HW.DAQCONTROLLER
doc hw.DaqController
daqController = hw.DaqController;

% This class deals with creating DAQ sessions, assigning output
% channels and generating the relevant waveforms to output to each
% channel.
 
% Example: Setting up water valve interface for a Signals behavour task In
% the romote rig's hardware.mat, instantiate a hw.DaqController object to
% interface with an NI DAQ

% Set the DAQ id (can be found with daq.getDevices)
daqController.DaqIds = 'Dev1';
% Add a new channel
daqController.ChannelNames = {'rewardValve'};
% Define the channel ID to output on
daqController.DaqChannelIds = {'ai0'};
% As it is an analogue output, set the AnalogueChannelsIdx to true
daqController.AnalogueChannelIdx(1) = true;
% Add a signal generator that will return the correct samples for
% delivering a reward of a specified volume
daqController.SignalGenerators(1) = hw.RewardValveControl;
% Set some of the required fields (see HW.REWARDVALVECONTROL for more info)
daqController.SignalGenerators(1).OpenValue = 5; % Volts
daqController.SignalGenerators(1).Calibrations = ...
valveDeliveryCalibration(openTimeRange, scalesPort, openValue,...
  closedValue, daqChannel, daqDevice);

% Save your hardware file
save(hardware, 'daqController', '-append');

%% Timeline
% Timeline unifies various hardware and software times using a DAQ device.
doc hw.Timeline

% Let's create a new object and configure some channels
timeline = hw.Timeline

% Setting UseTimeline to true allows timeline to be started by default at
% the start of each experiment.  Otherwise it can be toggled on and off by
% pressing the 't' key while running SRV.EXPSERVER.
timeline.UseTimeline = true;

% Timeline is not usually necessary outside of physiology recordings and
% can be left disabled.

% To set up chrono a wire must bridge the terminals defined in
% Outputs(1).DaqChannelID and Inputs(1).daqChannelID
% The current channal IDs are printed to the command by running the this:
timeline.wiringInfo('chrono');

% They may be changed by setting the above fields, e.g.
timeline.Outputs(1).DaqChannelID = 'port1/line1';
timeline.wiringInfo('chrono'); % New port # displayed

% INPUTS
% Add the rotary encoder
timeline.addInput('rotaryEncoder', 'ctr0', 'Position');
% For a lick detector
timeline.addInput('lickDetector', 'ctr1', 'EdgeCount');
% For a photodiode (see 'Configuring the visual stimuli' above)
timeline.addInput('photoDiode', 'ai2', 'Voltage', 'SingleEnded');

% OUTPUTS
% Say we wanted to trigger camera aquisition at a given frame rate:
clockOut = hw.TLOutputClock;
clockOut.DaqChannelID = 'ctr2'; % Set channal
clockOut.Name = 'Cam-Trigger'; % A memorable name
clockOut.Frequency = 180; % Hz
clockOut.Enable = 'on'; % Switch to enable and disable output
timeline.Outputs(end+1) = clockOut; % Assign to outputs

%Save your hardware.mat file
save(hardware, 'timeline', '-append')

% For more information on configuring and using Timeline, see
% TIMELINE doc:
open(fullfile(getOr(dat.paths,'rigbox'), 'docs', 'Timeline.m'))

%% Weigh scale
% MC allows you to log weights through the GUI by interfacing with a
% digital scale connected via a COM port. This is the only object of use in
% the MC computer's hardware file.
scale = hw.WeighingScale 

% The Name field should be set to the name or product code of the scale you
% connect.
scale.Name = 'SPX222';
% The COM port should be set to whichever port the scale is connected to.
% You can find out which ports are availiable in Windows by opening the
% Device Manager (Win + X, then M).  Under Universal Serial Bus, you can
% see all current USB and serial ports.  If you right-click and select
% 'Properties' you can view the port number and even reassign them (under
% Advanced)
scaleComPort = 'COM4'; % Set to a different port
% The TareCommand and FormatSpec fields should be set based on your scale's
% input and output configurations.  Check the manual.
TareCommand = 84; % 'T'
% For SPX222 the weight is transmitted directly, without any units.
% Other scales such as the ES-300HA transmit the weight along with the sign
% and units, e.g. '+ 24.01 g'.
FormatSpec = '%f'

%Save your hardware.mat file
save(hardware, 'scale', '-append')

%% - Using the scale
% The methods are rather self-explanatory.  To use the scale the port must
% first be opened using the INIT method:
scale.init() 

% To tare (zero) the scale, use the TARE method:
scale.tare()

% To return the last measured weight, use READGRAMS:
g = scale.readGrams()

% Finally the NewReading event allows one to add a listener for weight
% change events.  Let's print the readings to the command window:
callback = @(src,~) fprintf('New reading of %.2fg\n', src.readGrams);
lh = event.listener(scale, 'NewReading', callback);

% To clean up you can simply clear the object from the workspace:
clear scale lh

%% Audio devices
InitializePsychSound
devs = PsychPortAudio('GetDevices')
% Sanitize the names
names = matlab.lang.makeValidName({devs.DeviceName}, 'ReplacementStyle', 'delete');
names = iff(ismember('default', names), names, @()[{'default'} names(2:end)]);
for i = 1:length(names); devs(i).DeviceName = names{i}; end
audioDevices = devs;

save(hardware, 'audioDevices', '-append')

%% Loading your hardware file
% To load your rig hardware objects for testing at a rig, you can use
% HW.DEVICES:
rig = hw.devices; 

% To load the hardware file or a different rig, you can input the rig name.
% Note HW.DEVICES initializes some of the hardware by default, including
% creating DAQ sessions and adding any required channels.  To load without
% initializing:
rigName = 'ZREDONE';
initialize = false;
rig = hw.devices(rigName, initialize);

%% FAQ
%%% I tried loading an old hardware file but the variables are not objects.
% This was probably accompanied with an error such as:
% * |% Warning: Variable 'rewardController' originally saved as a
% hw.DaqRewardValve cannot be instantiated as an object and will be read in
% as a uint32.| *

% This usually means that there has been a substantial change in the code
% since the object was last saved and MATLAB can no longer load it into the
% workspace.  One solution is to revert your code to a release dated around
% the time of the hardware file's modified date:
hwPath = fullfile(getOr(dat.paths, 'rigConfig'), 'hardware.mat');
datestr(file.modDate(hwPath)) % Find the time file was last modified

% Once you have the previous parameters, create a new object with the
% current code version, assign the parameters and resave.  

%%% I'm missing the time of the first flip only, why?
% Perhaps the first flip is always too dark a colour.  Try reversing the
% order stimWindow.SyncColourCycle:
scc = stimWindow.SyncColourCycle;
scc = iff(size(scc,1) > size(scc,2), @() flipud(scc), @() fliplr(scc));
stimWindow.SyncColourCycle = scc;

%%% The PsychToolbox window covers the wrong monitors when I run the experiment server
% Make sure Mosaic is still running (sometimes if the computer loses a
% monitor input the graphics card disables Mosaic). One indication of this
% is that the task bar should stretch across all three of the stimulus
% screens. Also check that the stimWindow.ScreenNum is correct in the
% hardware.mat file. When set to 0, PsychToolbox uses all screens available
% to Windows; 1 means Windows primary screen (see the Display Settings); 2
% means Windows secondary screen, etc.

%%% I get a PTB synchronization error when I run the experiment server.
% This happens from time-to-time. When a PsychToolbox window is opened it
% runs some synchronization to retrace tests, checking whether buffer flips
% are properly synchronized to the vertical retrace signal of your display.
% Synchronization failiures indicate that there tareing or flickering may
% occur during stimulus presentation.  More info on this may be found
% <http://psychtoolbox.org/docs/SyncTrouble here> :
web('http://psychtoolbox.org/docs/SyncTrouble')
% The problem may be exacerbated if you're running other programs that
% interfere with the graphics, such as remote window viewers (VNC, Remote
% Desktpo, etc.), or if you are running multiple monitors that do not have
% the same make.  Sometimes simply re-running expServer works.  
% If you know what you're doing and are confident that things are working,
% you can skip the tests by setting the following property:
stimWindow.PtbSyncTests = false;

%%% Error using hw.DaqRotaryEncoder/readAbsolutePosition (line 143) 
% NI Error -88709 ?or Error using hw.DaqRotaryEncoder/createDaqChannel
% (line 81): The requested subsystem 'CounterInput' does not exist on this
% device.

% This happens from time to time, particularly after the computer has gone
% to sleep. Unplugging the DAQ USB cable and plugging it back in helps.
% Restart MATLAB. If the error persists, restart the computer with the DAQ
% unplugged.

%%% The experiment server is unable to open my DAQ on Dev1
% If you have multiple NI devices on this computer, set the DaqIds
% properties to the correct id in your hardware.mat file, i.e.
% daqController.DaqIds, mouseInput.DaqId, rewardController.DaqId
d = daq.getDevices % Availiable devices and their info

%%% My rotary encoder has a different resolution, how do I change the hardware config?
% Change the mouseInput.EncoderResolution peroperty to the value found at
% the end of your rotary encoders product number: e.g. 05.2400.1122.1024
% means EncoderResolution = 1024.
