% The 'dat.paths' file is used for configuring important paths for the
% computers which Rigbox runs on and communicates with. These include paths
% to: 
%
% 1) either the shared folder(s) OR the remote server(s) on which 
% organization-wide configuration files, subject data and experiment data 
% is stored, and a local directory for generating redundant copies of this 
% data 
% 
% 2) optionally, paths to a remote database (e.g., if using Alyx), 
% and a local redundant copy of that database
%
% 3) optionally, paths to any other directories for storing additional
% back-ups (e.g. for working analyses, tapes, etc...)
%
% 4) optionally, a path to a custom config file for the local computer.

% @todo: add instructions w/ code examples for setting up 'dat.paths'
