# Documentation:
This `docs` folder contains information on setting up and using Rigbox, as well as information on the organization of the repository. After installation, we recommend viewing Rigbox's [online documentation], which serves as an easy way to navigate through the information contained in this folder for setting-up and using Rigbox, via your web browser. Alternatively, you can view the `README` files in the `setup` and `usage` folders for instructions on the order in which to view the `.m` guides within these folders in MATLAB.
